<h1>THE GIRLS OF HILLCREST FARM</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>EVERYTHING AT ONCE!</span></h2>

<p>Whenever she heard the siren of the ladder-truck,
as it swung out of its station on the neighboring
street, Lydia Bray ran to the single window
of the flat that looked out on Trimble
Avenue.</p>

<p>They were four flights up. There were
twenty-three other families in this &#8220;double-decker.&#8221;
A fire in the house was the oldest Bray
girl&#8217;s nightmare by night and haunting spectre
by day.</p>

<p>Lydia just couldn&#8217;t get used to these quarters,
and they had been here now three months. The
old, quiet home on the edge of town had been
so different. To it she had returned from college
so short a time ago to see her mother die and
find their affairs in a state of chaos.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>For her father was one of those men who
leave everything to the capable management of
their wives. Euphemia, or &#8220;&#8217;Phemie,&#8221; was only
a schoolgirl, then, in her junior year at high
school; &#8220;Lyddy&#8221; was a sophomore at Littleburg
when her mother died, and she had never
gone back.</p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t. There were two very good
reasons why her own and even &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s education
had to cease abruptly. Their mother&#8217;s income,
derived from their grandmother&#8217;s estate,
ceased with her death. They could not live, let
alone pursue education &#8220;on the heights,&#8221; upon
Mr. Bray&#8217;s wages as overseer in one of the rooms
of the hat factory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s hundred dollars a month was just
the difference between poverty and comfort,&#8221;
Lyddy had decided, when she took the strings of
the household into her own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t that hundred dollars a month;
father makes but fifteen dollars weekly; <i>you</i> will
have to go to work at something, &#8217;Phemie, and
so will I.&#8221;</p>

<p>And no longer could they pay twenty-five dollars
a month house rent. Lyddy had first placed
her sister with a millinery firm at six dollars
weekly, and had then found this modest tenement
about half-way between her father&#8217;s factory and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
&#8217;Phemie&#8217;s millinery shop, so that it would be
equally handy for both workers.</p>

<p>As for herself, Lyddy wished to obtain some
employment that would occupy only a part of
her day, and in this she had been unsuccessful as
yet. She religiously bought a paper every morning,
and went through the &#8220;help wanted&#8221; columns,
answering every one that looked promising.
She had tried many kinds of &#8220;work at
home for ladies,&#8221; and canvassing, and the like.
The latter did not pay for shoe-leather, and the
&#8220;work at home&#8221; people were mostly swindlers.
Lyddy was no needle-woman, so she could not
make anything as a seamstress.</p>

<p>She had promised her mother to keep the family
together and make a home for her father.
Mr. Bray was not well. For almost two years
now the doctor had been warning him to get out
of the factory and into some other business. The
felt-dust was hurting him.</p>

<p>He had come in but the minute before and had
at once gone to lie down, exhausted by his climb
up the four flights of stairs. &#8217;Phemie had not yet
returned from work, for it was nearing Easter,
despite the rawness of the days, and the millinery
shop was busy until late. They always
waited supper for &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Now, when Lyddy ran to the window at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
raucous shriek of the ladder-truck siren, she hoped
she would see her sister turning the corner into
the avenue, where the electric arc-light threw a
great circle of radiance upon the wet walk.</p>

<p>But although there was the usual crowd at the
corner, and all seemed to be in a hurry to-night,
Lyddy saw nothing of either her sister or the ladder-truck.
She went back to the kitchen, satisfied
that the fire apparatus had not swung into
their street, so the tenement must be safe for the
time being.</p>

<p>She finished laying the table for supper. Once
she looked up. There was that man at the window
again!</p>

<p>That is, he <i>would</i> be a man some day, Lyddy
told herself. But she believed, big as he was, he
was just a hobbledehoy-boy. He was a boy who,
if one looked at him, just <i>had</i> to smile. And he
was always working in a white apron and brown
straw cuff-shields at that window which was a
little above the level of Lyddy&#8217;s kitchen window.</p>

<p>Lyddy Bray abominated flirting and such silly
practises. And although the boy at the window
was really good to look upon&#8211;cleanly shaven,
rosy-cheeked, with good eyes set wide apart, and
a firm, broad chin&#8211;Lyddy did not like to see him
every time she raised her eyes from her own
kitchen tasks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>Often, even on dark days, she drew the shade
down so that she should have more privacy. For
sometimes the young man looked idly out of the
window and Lyddy believed that, had she given
him any encouragement, he would have opened
his own window and spoken to her.</p>

<p>The place in which he worked was a tall loft
building; she believed he was employed in some
sort of chemical laboratory. There were retorts,
and strange glass and copper instruments in partial
view upon his bench.</p>

<p>Now, having lighted the gas, Lyddy stepped to
the window to pull down the shade closely and
shut the young man out. He was staring with
strange eagerness at her&#8211;or, at least, in her direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Master Impudence!&#8221; murmured Lyddy.</p>

<p>He flung up his window just as she reached
for the shade. But she saw then that he was
looking above her story.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s those Smith girls, I declare,&#8221; thought
Lyddy. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they bold creatures? And&#8211;really&#8211;I
thought he was too nice a boy&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the girl of it! She was shocked at
the thought of having any clandestine acquaintance
with the young man opposite; yet it cheapened
him dreadfully in Lyddy&#8217;s eyes to see him
fall prey to the designing girls in the flat above.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
The Smith girls had flaunted their cheap finery
in the faces of Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie Bray ever
since the latter had come here to live.</p>

<p>She did not pull the shade down for a moment.
That boy certainly was acting in a most outrageous
manner!</p>

<p>His body was thrust half-way out of the window
as he knelt on his bench among the retorts.
She saw several of the delicate glass instruments
overturned by his vigorous motions. She saw
his lips open and he seemed to be shouting something
to those in the window above.</p>

<p>&#8220;How rude of him,&#8221; thought the disappointed
Lyddy. He had looked to be <i>such</i> a nice young
man.</p>

<p>Again she would have pulled down the shade,
but the boy&#8217;s actions stayed her hand.</p>

<p>He leaped back from the window and disappeared&#8211;for
just a moment. Then he staggered
into view, thrust a long and wide plank through
his open window, and, bearing down upon it,
shoved hard and fast, thrusting the novel bridge
up to the sill of the window above Lyddy&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>&#8220;What under the sun does that fellow mean
to do?&#8221; gasped the girl, half tempted to raise her
own window so as to look up the narrow shaft
between the two buildings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>&#8220;He never would attempt to cross over to
their flat,&#8221; thought Lyddy. &#8220;That would be
quite too&#8211;ri&#8211;dic&#8211;u&#8211;lous&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>The youth was adjusting the plank. At first
he could not steady it upon the sill above Lyddy&#8217;s
kitchen window. And how dangerous it would
be if he attempted to &#8220;walk the plank.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then there was a roaring sound above,
a glare of light, a crash of glass and a billow
of black smoke suddenly&#8211;but only for a
moment&#8211;filled the space between the two buildings!</p>

<p>The girl almost fell to the floor. She had
always been afraid of fire, and it had been ever
in her mind since they moved into this big tenement
house. And now it had come without her
knowing it!</p>

<p>While she thought the young man to be trying
to enter into a flirtation with the girls in the
flat above, the house was afire! No wonder so
many people had seemed running at the corner
when she looked out of the front window. The
ladder-truck had swung around into the avenue
without her seeing it. Doubtless the street in
front of the tenement was choked with fire-fighting
apparatus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me!&#8221; gasped Lyddy, reeling for the
moment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>Then she dashed for the bedroom where her
father lay. Smoke was sifting in from the
hall through the cracks about the ill-hung
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! Father!&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>He lay on the bed, as still as though sleeping.
But the noise above should have aroused him
by this time, had her own shrill cry not done so.</p>

<p>Yet he did not move.</p>

<p>Lyddy leaped to the bedside, seizing her
father&#8217;s shoulder with desperate clutch. She
shook his frail body, and the head wagged from
side to side on the pillow in so horrible a way&#8211;so
lifeless and helpless&#8211;that she was smitten
with terror.</p>

<p>Was he dead? He had never been like this
before, she was positive.</p>

<p>She tore open his waistcoat and shirt and placed
her hand upon his heart. It was beating&#8211;but,
oh, how feebly!</p>

<p>And then she heard the flat door opened with
a key&#8211;&#8217;Phemie&#8217;s key. Her sister cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Lyddy! the hall is full of smoke.
It isn&#8217;t your stove that&#8217;s smoking so, I hope?
And here&#8217;s Aunt Jane Hammond come to see us.
I met her on the street, and these four flights
of stairs have almost killed her&#8213;Why! what&#8217;s
happened, Lyddy?&#8221; the younger girl broke off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
to ask, as her sister&#8217;s pale face appeared at the
bedroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8211;everything&#8217;s happened at once,
I guess,&#8221; replied Lyddy, faintly. &#8220;Father&#8217;s sick&#8211;we&#8217;ve
got company&#8211;and the house is afire!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>AUNT JANE PROPOSES</span></h2>

<p>Aunt Jane Hammond stalked into the
meagerly furnished parlor, and looked around.
It was the first time she had been to see the
Bray girls since their &#8220;come down&#8221; in the world.</p>

<p>She was a tall, gaunt woman&#8211;their mother&#8217;s
half-sister, and much older than Mrs. Bray would
have been had she lived. Aunt Jane, indeed, had
been married herself when her father, Dr.
&#8220;Polly&#8221; Phelps, had married his second wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must&#8211;say I&#8211;expected to&#8211;see some&#8211;angels
sit&#8211;ting a&#8211;round&#8211;when I got up here,&#8221;
panted Aunt Jane, grimly, and dropping into the
most comfortable chair. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you have
got a mite nearer heaven, if you&#8217;d tried, Lyddy
Bray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; gasped Lyddy. &#8220;There&#8217;s another
story on top of this; but it&#8217;s afire just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; shrieked Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it, Lyddy?&#8221; cried her
sister. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what the smoke means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; declared their aunt, &#8220;them firemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
will have to carry me out, then. I couldn&#8217;t walk
downstairs again right now, for no money!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie ran to the hall door. But when
she opened it a great blast of choking smoke
drove in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;We can&#8217;t escape by
the stairway. What&#8217;ll we do? What <i>shall</i> we
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the fire-escape,&#8221; said Lyddy, trembling
so that she could scarcely stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Aunt Jane again. &#8220;<i>Me</i> go
down one o&#8217; them dinky little ladders&#8211;and me
with a hole as big as a half-dollar in the back
of my stockin&#8217;? I never knowed it till I got
started from home; the seam just gave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d look nice going down that ladder. I
guess not, says Con!&#8221; and she shook her head
so vigorously that all the little jet trimmings
upon her bonnet danced and sparkled in the gaslight
just as her beadlike, black eyes snapped and
danced.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8211;we&#8217;re in danger, Lyddy!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie,
tremulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the boy!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy, and flew
to the kitchen, just in time to see the Smith
family sliding down the plank into the laboratory&#8211;the
two girls ahead, then Mother Smith, then
Johnny Smith, and then the father. And all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
while the boy next door held the plank firmly
in place against the window-sill of the burning
flat.</p>

<p>Lyddy threw up the window and screamed
something to him as the last Smith passed him
and disappeared. She couldn&#8217;t have told what
she said, for the very life of her; but the young
man across the shaft knew what she meant.</p>

<p>He drew back the plank a little way, swung
his weight upon the far end of it, and then let
it drop until it was just above the level of her sill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grab it and pull, Miss!&#8221; he called across
the intervening space.</p>

<p>Lyddy obeyed. There was great confusion in
the hall now, and overhead the fire roared loudly.
The firemen were evidently pressing up the congested
stairway with a line or two of hose, and
driving the frightened people back into their tenements.
If the fire was confined to the upper
floor of the double-decker there would be really
little danger to those below.</p>

<p>But Lyddy was too frightened to realize this
last fact. She planted the end of the plank upon
her own sill and saw that it was secure. But it
sloped upward more than a trifle. How would
they ever be able to creep up that inclined plane&#8211;and
four flights from the bottom of the shaft?</p>

<p>But to her consternation, the young fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
across the way deliberately stepped out upon the
plank, sat down, and slid swiftly across to her.
Lyddy sprang back with a cry, and he came in
at the window and stood before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re in any danger, Miss,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;The firemen are on the roof, and
probably up through the halls, too. The fire
has burned a vent through the roof and&#8213;Yes!
hear the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could plainly hear the swish of the streams
from the hosepipes. Then the water thundered
on the floor above their heads. Almost at once
small streams began to pour through the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; cried Lyddy. &#8220;Right on the supper
table!&#8221;</p>

<p>A stream fell hissing on the stove. The big
boy drew her swiftly out of the room into her
father&#8217;s bedroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That ceiling will come down,&#8221; he said,
hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8211;but if you&#8217;re insured you&#8217;ll
be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy at that moment remembered that she had
never taken out insurance on the poor sticks of
furniture left from the wreck of their larger
home. Yet, if everything was spoiled&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221; asked the
young fellow, looking at the bed where Mr. Bray
lay. He had wonderfully sharp eyes, it seemed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8211;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; moaned
Lyddy. &#8220;Do you think it is the smoke? He
has been ill a long time&#8211;almost too sick to
work&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get an ambulance, if you say so&#8211;and a
doctor. Are you afraid to stay here now? Are
you all alone but for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister&#8211;and my aunt,&#8221; gasped Lyddy.
&#8220;They&#8217;re in the front room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep &#8217;em there,&#8221; said the young man.
&#8220;Maybe they won&#8217;t pour so much water into
those front rooms. Look out for the ceilings.
You might be hurt if they came down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found the key and unlocked and opened
the door from the bedroom to the hall. The
smoke cloud was much thinner. But a torrent
of water was pouring down the stairs, and the
shouting and stamping of the firemen above were
louder.</p>

<p>Two black, serpent-like lines of hose encumbered
the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself,&#8221; called the young
man. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a jiffy with the doctor,&#8221;
and, bareheaded, and in shirt-sleeves as he was,
he dashed down the dark and smoky stairway.</p>

<p>Lyddy bent over her father again; he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
breathing more peacefully, it seemed. But when
she spoke to him he did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie ran in, crying. &#8220;What is the matter
with father?&#8221; she demanded, as she noted his
strange silence. Then, without waiting for an
answer, she snapped:</p>

<p>&#8220;And Aunt Jane&#8217;s got her head out of the window
scolding at the firemen in the street because
they do not come up and carry her downstairs
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the fire&#8217;s nearly out, I guess,&#8221; groaned
Lyddy.</p>

<p>Then the girls clutched each other and were
stricken speechless as a great crash sounded from
the kitchen. As the young man from the laboratory
had prophesied, the ceiling had fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I had the nicest biscuits for supper I
ever made,&#8221; moaned Lyddy. &#8220;They were just
as fluffy&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bother your biscuits!&#8221; snapped &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;Have you had the doctor for father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;ve sent for one,&#8221; replied Lyddy, faintly,
suddenly conscience-stricken by the fact that she
had accepted the assistance of the young stranger,
to whom she had never been introduced! &#8220;Oh,
dear! I hope he comes soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been this way, Lyd? Why
didn&#8217;t you send for me?&#8221; demanded the younger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
sister, clasping her hands and leaning over the
unconscious man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he came home from work just as usual.
I&#8211;I didn&#8217;t notice that he was worse,&#8221; replied the
older girl, breathlessly. &#8220;He said he&#8217;d lie
down&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have called the doctor then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, dear, I tell you he seemed just the
same. He almost always lies down when he
comes home now. You know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Lyddy!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie,
contritely. &#8220;Of course you are just as careful
of father as you can be. But&#8211;but it&#8217;s so <i>awful</i>
to see him lie like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He fainted without my knowing a thing
about it,&#8221; moaned Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if it&#8217;s only just a faint&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t even have heard the noise upstairs
over the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a stream of water descended through
the cracked bedroom ceiling, first upon the back
of &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s neck, and then upon the drugget
which covered the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose <i>this</i> ceiling falls, too?&#8221; wailed
Lyddy, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not! And we&#8217;ll have to pay the
doctor when he comes, Lyd. Have you got
money enough in your purse?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>&#8220;I&#8211;I guess so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have any more after this week,&#8221;
broke out &#8217;Phemie, suddenly. &#8220;They told me
to-day the rush for Easter would be over Saturday
night and they would have to let me go till
next season. Isn&#8217;t that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lydia Bray had sat down upon the edge of
their father&#8217;s bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess everything <i>has</i> happened at once,&#8221;
she sighed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see what we shall do,
&#8217;Phemie.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a scream from Aunt Jane. She
charged into the bedroom wildly, the back of
her dress all wet and her bonnet dangling over
one ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, your parlor ceiling is just spouting
water, girls!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>Then she turned to look closely at the man
on the bed. &#8220;John Bray looks awful bad,
Lyddy. What does the doctor say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before her niece could reply there came a
thundering knock at the hall door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Lyddy feared it was the young stranger returning,
and she could only gasp. What should
she say to him if he came in? How introduce
him to Aunt Jane?</p>

<p>But the latter lady took affairs into her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
hands at this juncture and went to the door.
She unlocked and threw it open. Several helmets
and glistening rubber coats appeared vaguely in
the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting wet down here some; aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
asked one of the firemen. &#8220;We&#8217;ll spread some
tarpaulins over your stuff. Fire&#8217;s out&#8211;about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the water&#8217;s <i>in</i>,&#8221; returned Aunt Jane,
tartly. &#8220;Nice time to come and try to save a
body&#8217;s furniture&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it out of the adjusters. They&#8217;ll be
around,&#8221; said the fireman, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much insurance have you, Lyddy?&#8221;
demanded the aunt, when the firemen, after covering
the already wet and bedraggled furniture,
had clumped out in their heavy boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a penny, Aunt Jane!&#8221; cried her niece,
wildly. &#8220;I never thought of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! you&#8217;re not so much like your mother,
then, as I thought. <i>She</i> would never have overlooked
such a detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it! I know it!&#8221; moaned Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you stop that, Aunt Jane!&#8221; exclaimed
the bolder &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you hound Lyd.
She&#8217;s done fine&#8211;of course she has! But anybody
might forget a thing like insurance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; grunted the old lady. Then she
began again:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the matter with John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the shop, Aunt,&#8221; replied Lyddy. &#8220;He
cannot stand the work any longer. I wish he
might never go back to that place again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how are you going to live? What&#8217;s
&#8217;Phemie getting a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8211;after this week,&#8221; returned the
younger girl, shortly. &#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have any work,
and I&#8217;ve only been earning six dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; observed Aunt Jane for a second
time.</p>

<p>There came a light tap on the door. They
could hear it, for the confusion and shouting in
the house had abated. The fire scare was over;
but the floor above was gutted, and a good deal
of damage by water had been done on this floor.</p>

<p>It was a physician, bag in hand. &#8217;Phemie let
him in. Lyddy explained how her father had
come home and lain down and she had found
him, when the fire scare began, unconscious on
the bed&#8211;just as he lay now.</p>

<p>A few questions explained to the physician the
condition of Mr. Bray, and his own observation
revealed the condition of the tenement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be better off at the hospital. You
are about wrecked here, I see. That young man
who called me said he would ring up the City
Hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>The girls were greatly troubled; but Aunt Jane
was practical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, that&#8217;s the best place for him,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Why! this flat isn&#8217;t fit for a well person
to stay in, let alone a sick man, until it is cleared
up. I shall take you girls out with me to my
boarding house for the night. Then&#8211;we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician brought Mr. Bray to his senses;
but the poor man knew nothing about the fire,
and was too weak to object when they told him
he was to be removed to the hospital for a time.</p>

<p>The ambulance came and the young interne
and the driver brought in the stretcher, covered
Mr. Bray with a gray blanket, and took him
away. The interne told the girls they could see
their father in the morning and he, too, said it
was mainly exhaustion that had brought about
the sudden attack.</p>

<p>Aunt Jane had been stalking about the sloppy
flat&#8211;from the ruined kitchen to the front window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut and lock that kitchen window, and lock
the doors, and we&#8217;ll go out and find a lodging,&#8221;
she said, briefly. &#8220;You girls can bring a bag
for the night. Mine&#8217;s at the station hard by;
I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t bring it up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was when Lyddy shut and locked the kitchen
window that she remembered the young man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
again. The plank had been removed, the
laboratory window was closed, and the place unlighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he has some of the instincts of a gentleman,
after all,&#8221; she told herself. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t
come back to bother me after doing what he could
to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hours later the Bray girls were seated in
their aunt&#8217;s comfortable room at a boarding house
on a much better block than the one on which
the tenement stood. Aunt Jane had ordered up
tea and toast, and was sipping the one and nibbling
the other contentedly before a grate fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I call comfort,&#8221; declared the
old lady, who still kept her bonnet on&#8211;nor would
she remove it save to change it for a nightcap
when she went to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I call comfort. A pleasant
room in a house where I have no responsibilities,
and enough noise outside to assure me that I am
in a live town. My goodness me! when Hammond
came along and wanted to marry me, and I
knew I could leave Hillcrest and never have to
go back&#8213;Well, I just about jumped down that
man&#8217;s throat I was so eager to say &#8216;Yes!&#8217;
Marry him? I&#8217;d ha&#8217; married a Choctaw Injun,
if he&#8217;d promised to take me to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Aunt Jane!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
&#8220;Hillcrest Farm is a beautiful place. Mother
took us there once to see it. Don&#8217;t you remember,
&#8217;Phemie? <i>She</i> loved it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I wish she&#8217;d had it as a gift from the
old doctor,&#8221; grumbled Aunt Jane. &#8220;But it
wasn&#8217;t to be. It&#8217;s never been anything but a
nuisance to me, if I <i>was</i> born there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the view from the porch is the loveliest
I ever saw,&#8221; said Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all that romantic pile of rocks at the
back of the farm!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! what&#8217;s a view?&#8221; demanded the old lady,
in her brusk way. &#8220;Just dirt and water. And
that&#8217;s what they say <i>we&#8217;re</i> made of. I like to
study human bein&#8217;s, I do; so I&#8217;d ruther have my
view in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so pretty&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fudge!&#8221; snapped Aunt Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
the time, when I was a growin&#8217; gal, and the old
doctor was off to see patients, that I&#8217;ve stood on
that same porch at Hillcrest and just <i>cried</i> for the
sight of somethin&#8217; movin&#8217; on the face of Natur&#8217;
besides a cow.</p>

<p>&#8220;View, indeed!&#8221; she pursued, hotly. &#8220;If
I&#8217;ve got to look at views, I want plenty of &#8216;life&#8217;
in &#8217;em; and I want the human figgers to be right
up close in the foreground, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie laughed. &#8220;And I think it would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
just <i>blessed</i> to get out of this noisy, dirty city,
and live in a place like Hillcrest. Wouldn&#8217;t you
like it, Lyd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love it!&#8221; declared her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Jane, sitting
bolt upright, and looking actually startled.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that a way out, mebbe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Aunt Jane?&#8221; asked
Lydia, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how I&#8217;m fixed, girls. Hammond
left me just money enough so&#8217;t I can live as I
like to live&#8211;and no more. The farm&#8217;s never
been aught but an expense to me. Cyrus Pritchett
is supposed to farm a part of it on shares; but
my share of the crops never pays more&#8217;n the taxes
and the repairs to the roofs of the old buildings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be a shelter to ye. The furniture stands
jest as it did in the old doctor&#8217;s day. Ye could
move right in&#8211;and I expect it would mean a lease
of life to your father.</p>

<p>&#8220;A second-hand man wouldn&#8217;t give ye ten
dollars for your stuff in that flat. It&#8217;s ruined.
Ye couldn&#8217;t live comfortable there any more. But
if ye wanter go to Hillcrest I&#8217;m sure ye air more
than welcome to the use of the place, and perhaps
ye might git a bigger share of the crops out of
Cyrus if ye was there, than I&#8217;ve been able to git.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;you say, girls&#8211;what d&#8217;you say?&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DOCTOR DISPOSES</span></h2>

<p>The Bray girls scarcely slept a wink that night.
Not alone were they excited by the incidents of
the evening, and the sudden illness of their father;
but the possibilities arising out of Aunt Jane
Hammond&#8217;s suggestion fired the imagination of
both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>These sisters were eminently practical girls,
and they came of practical stock&#8211;as note the old-fashioned
names which their unromantic parents
had put upon them in their helpless infancy.</p>

<p>Yet there is a dignity to &#8220;Lydia&#8221; and a beauty
to &#8220;Euphemia&#8221; which the thoughtless may not
at once appreciate.</p>

<p>Practical as they were, the thought of going
to the old farmhouse to live&#8211;if their father could
be moved to it at once&#8211;added a zest to their
present situation which almost made their misfortune
seem a blessing.</p>

<p>Their furniture was spoiled, as Aunt Jane had
said. And father was sick&#8211;a self-evident fact.
This sudden ill turn which Mr. Bray had suffered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
worried both of his daughters more than
any other trouble&#8211;indeed, more than all the
others in combination.</p>

<p>Their home was ruined&#8211;but, somehow, they
would manage to find a shelter. &#8217;Phemie would
have no more work in her present position after
this week, and Lyddy had secured no work at
all; but fortune must smile upon their efforts and
bring them work in time.</p>

<p>These obstacles seemed small indeed beside the
awful thought of their father&#8217;s illness. How
very, very weak and ill he had looked when he
was carried out of the flat on that stretcher!
The girls clung together in their bed in the lodging
house, and whispered about it, far into the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he never comes out of that hospital?&#8221;
suggested &#8217;Phemie, in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Phemie! don&#8217;t!&#8221; begged her sister.
&#8220;He <i>can&#8217;t</i> be so ill as all that. It&#8217;s just a breakdown,
as that doctor said. He has overworked.
He&#8211;he mustn&#8217;t ever go back to that hat shop
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; breathed &#8217;Phemie; &#8220;but what <i>will</i>
he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t up to him to do anything&#8211;it&#8217;s up to
<i>us</i>,&#8221; declared Lyddy, with some measure of her
confidence returning. &#8220;Why, look at us! Two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
big, healthy girls, with four capable hands and
the average amount of brains.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, as city workers, we are arrant failures,&#8221;
she continued, in a whisper, for their room
was right next to Aunt Jane&#8217;s, and the partition
was thin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose we could do better in the
country?&#8221; asked &#8217;Phemie, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I am not mistaken the house is full
of old, fine furniture,&#8221; observed Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; sighed the younger sister, &#8220;we&#8217;d be
sheltered, anyway. But how about eating?
Lyddy! I have <i>such</i> an appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She says we can have her share of the crops
if we will pay the taxes and make the necessary
repairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crops! what do you suppose is growing in
those fields at this time of the year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much. But if we could get out there
early we might have a garden and see to it that
Mr. Pritchett planted a proper crop. And we
could have chickens&#8211;I&#8217;d love that,&#8221; said Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, goodness, gracious me! Wouldn&#8217;t we
<i>all</i> love it&#8211;father, too? But how can we even
get out there, much more live till vegetables and
chickens are ripe, on nothing a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8211;is&#8211;what&#8211;I&#8211;don&#8217;t&#8211;see&#8211;yet,&#8221; admitted
Lyddy, slowly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of Aunt Jane,&#8221; complained
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;But it&#8217;s just like opening the door
of Heaven to a person who has no wings! We
can&#8217;t even reach Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and I could,&#8221; said her sister, vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;How, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Lyd! It&#8217;s fifty miles if it&#8217;s a step!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nearer seventy. Takes two hours on the
train to the nearest station; and then you ride
up the mountain a long, long way. But we could
walk it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And be tramps&#8211;regular tramps,&#8221; cried
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d rather be a tramp than a pauper,&#8221;
declared the older sister, vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;But poor father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; agreed Lydia. &#8220;Of course,
we can do nothing of the kind. We cannot leave
him while he is sick, nor can we take him out
there to Hillcrest if he gets on his feet
again&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lyddy! don&#8217;t talk that way. He <i>is</i> going
to be all right after a few days&#8217; rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think he will ever be well if he goes
back to work in that hat factory. If we could
only get him to Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there we&#8217;d all starve to death in a hurry,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
grumbled &#8217;Phemie, punching the hard, little
boarding-house pillow. &#8220;Oh, dear! what&#8217;s the
use of talking? There is no way out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a way out&#8211;if we think hard
enough,&#8221; returned her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish you&#8217;d promulgate one,&#8221; sniffed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to think&#8211;and you do the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Snore!&#8221; finished &#8217;Phemie. That ended the
discussion for the time being. But Lydia lay
awake and racked her tired brain for hours.</p>

<p>The pale light of the raw March morning
streaked the window-pane when Lydia was awakened
by her sister hurrying into her clothes for
the day&#8217;s work at the millinery store. There
would be but two days more for her there.</p>

<p>And then?</p>

<p>It was a serious problem. Lydia had perhaps
ten dollars in her reserve fund. Father might
not be paid for his full week if he did not go back
to the shop. His firm was not generous, despite
the fact that Mr. Bray had worked so long for
them. A man past forty, who is frequently sick
a day or two at a time, soon wears out the patience
of employers, especially when there is
young blood in the firm.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie would get her week&#8217;s pay Saturday
night. Altogether, Lyddy might find thirty dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
in her hand with which to face the future
for all three of them!</p>

<p>What could she get for their soaked furniture?
These thoughts were with her while she was
dressing.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie had hurried away after making her
sister promise to telephone as to her father&#8217;s
condition the minute they allowed Lyddy to see
him at the hospital. Aunt Jane was a luxurious
lie-abed, and had ordered tea and toast for nine
o&#8217;clock. Her oldest niece put on her shabby hat
and coat and went out to the nearest lunch-room,
where coffee and rolls were her breakfast.</p>

<p>Then she walked down to Trimble Avenue and
approached the huge, double-decker where they
had lived. Salvage men were already carrying
away the charred fragments of the furniture from
the top floor. Lyddy hoped that, unlike herself,
the Smiths and the others up there had been insured
against fire.</p>

<p>She plodded wearily up the four flights and
unlocked one of the flat doors and entered. Two
of the salvage men followed her in and removed
the tarpaulins&#8211;which had been worse than useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm done but a little water, Miss,&#8221; said
one of them, consolingly. &#8220;But you talk up to
the adjuster and he&#8217;ll make it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>They all thought, of course, that the Brays&#8217; furniture
was insured. Lyddy closed the door and
looked over the wrecked flat.</p>

<p>The parlor furniture coverings were all
stained, and the carpet&#8217;s colors had &#8220;run&#8221; fearfully.
Many of their little keepsakes and &#8220;gim-cracks&#8221;
had been broken when the tarpaulins were
spread.</p>

<p>The bedrooms were in better shape, although
the bedding was somewhat wet. But the kitchen
was ruined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; thought Lyddy, &#8220;there wasn&#8217;t
much to ruin. Everything was cheap enough.
But what a mess to clean up!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked out of the window across the air-shaft.
There was the boy!</p>

<p>He nodded and beckoned to her. He had his
own window open. Lydia considered that she
had no business to talk with this young man; yet
he had played the &#8220;friend in need&#8221; the evening
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your father?&#8221; he called, the moment
she opened her window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know yet. They told me not to
come to the hospital until nine-thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re in a mess over there&#8211;eh?&#8221; he
said, with his most boyish smile.</p>

<p>But Lyddy was not for idle converse. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
nodded, thanked him for his kindness the evening
before, and firmly shut the window. She thought
she knew how to keep <i>that</i> young man in his
place.</p>

<p>But she hadn&#8217;t the heart to do anything toward
tidying up the flat now. And how she wished she
might not <i>have</i> to do it!</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only take our clothing and the
bedding and little things, and walk out,&#8221; she murmured,
standing in the middle of the little parlor.</p>

<p>To try to &#8220;pick up the pieces&#8221; here was going
to be dreadfully hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish some fairy would come along and
transport us all to Hillcrest Farm in the twinkling
of an eye,&#8221; said Lyddy to herself. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;d
rather starve out there than live as we have
for the past three months here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the door of the flat just as somebody
tapped gently on the panel. A poorly
dressed Jewish man stood hesitating on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said Lyddy, hastily; &#8220;but we had
trouble here last night&#8211;a fire. I can&#8217;t cook anything,
and really haven&#8217;t a thing to give&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother had boasted that she had never
turned away a beggar hungry from her door, and
the oldest Bray girl always tried to feed the deserving.
The man shook his head eagerly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t de idee got, lady,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
know dere vas a fire. I foller de fires, lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You follow the fires?&#8221; returned Lyddy, in
wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, lady. Don&#8217;dt you vant to sell de house-holdt
furnishings? I pay de highest mar-r-ket
brice for &#8217;em. Yes, lady&#8211;I pay cash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You vas nodt insured&#8211;yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Den I bay you cash for de goots undt you
go undt puy new&#8211;ain&#8217;dt idt?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lyddy wasn&#8217;t thinking of buying new furniture&#8211;not
at all. She opened the door wider.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in and look,&#8221; she invited. &#8220;What
will you pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clodings, too?&#8221; he asked, shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! We will keep the clothing, bedding
and kitchenware, and the like. Just the furniture.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man went through the flat quickly, but his
bright, beady eyes missed nothing. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I gif you fifteen tollar, lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no! that is too little,&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>She had begun to figure mentally what it would
cost to replace even the poor little things they
had. And yet, if she could get any fair price
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
for the goods she was almost tempted to sell
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady! believe me, I make a goot offer,&#8221; declared
the man. &#8220;But I must make it a profit&#8211;no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t sell for so little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much you vant, den?&#8221; he asked
shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! a great deal more than that. Ten dollars
more, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-fife tollars!&#8221; he cried, wringing his
hands. &#8220;Belief me, lady, I shouldt be shtuck!&#8221;</p>

<p>His use of English would have amused Lyddy
at another time; but the girl&#8217;s mind was set upon
something more important. If she only <i>could</i>
get enough money together to carry them all to
Hillcrest Farm&#8211;and to keep them going for a
while!</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen dollars would not do me much good,
I am afraid,&#8221; the girl said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, lady! you could buy a whole new house-furnishings
mit so much money down&#8211;undt pay
for de rest on de installment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Lyddy, firmly. &#8220;I want to get
away from here altogether. I want to get out
into the country. My father is sick; we had to
send him to the hospital last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second-hand man shook his head. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
vas a kindt-hearted lady,&#8221; he said, with less of
his professional whine. &#8220;I gif you twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>And above that sum Lyddy could not move
him. But she would not decide then and there.
She felt that she must see her father, and consult
with &#8217;Phemie, and possibly talk to Aunt Jane,
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come here to-morrow morning and I&#8217;ll
tell you,&#8221; she said, finally.</p>

<p>She locked the flat again and followed the
man down the long flights to the street. It was
not far to the hospital and Lyddy did not arrive
there much before the visitors&#8217; hour.</p>

<p>The house physician called her into his office
before she went up to the ward in which her
father had been placed. Already she was assured
that he was comfortable, so the keenness of her
anxiety was allayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your circumstances, Miss Bray?&#8221;
demanded the medical head of the hospital,
bluntly. &#8220;I mean your financial circumstances?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8211;we are poor, sir. And we were burned
out last night, and have no insurance. I do not
know what we really shall do&#8211;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the house-mother&#8211;eh?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the oldest. There are only Euphemia
and me, beside poor papa&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s regarding your father I must
speak. He&#8217;s in a bad way. We can do him
little good here, save that he will rest and have
nourishing food. But if he goes back to work
again&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s bad for him!&#8221; cried Lyddy, with
clasped hands. &#8220;But what can we do? He
<i>will</i> crawl out to the shop as long as they will
let him come&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not crawl out for a couple of weeks&#8211;I&#8217;ll
see to that,&#8221; said the doctor, grimly. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
stay here. But beyond that time I cannot promise.
Our public wards are very crowded, and of course,
you have no relatives, nor friends, able to furnish
a private room&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir!&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor is <i>that</i> the best for him. He ought to
be out of the city altogether&#8211;country air and
food&#8211;mountain air especially&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hillcrest!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy, aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; the doctor snapped at her,
quickly.</p>

<p>She told him about the farm&#8211;where it was,
and all.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good place for him,&#8221; replied the
physician, coolly. &#8220;It&#8217;s three or four hundred
feet higher above sea-level than the city. It will
do him more good to live in that air than a ton
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
of medicine. And he can go in two weeks, or
so. Good-morning, Miss Bray,&#8221; and the busy
doctor hurried away to his multitude of duties,
having disposed of Mr. Bray&#8217;s case on the instant.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PILGRIMAGE</span></h2>

<p>Lydia Bray was shocked indeed when they
allowed her in the ward to see her father. A
nurse had drawn a screen about the bed, and
nodded to her encouragingly.</p>

<p>The pallor of Mr. Bray&#8217;s countenance, as he
lay there with his eyes closed, unaware of her
presence, frightened the girl. She had never
seen him utterly helpless before. He had managed
to get around every day, even if sometimes
he could not go to work.</p>

<p>But now the forces of his system seemed to
have suddenly given out. He had overtaxed
Nature, and she was paying him for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyddy!&#8221; he whispered, when finally his heavy-lidded
eyes opened and he saw her standing beside
the cot.</p>

<p>The girl made a brave effort to look and speak
cheerfully; and Mr. Bray&#8217;s comprehension was
so dulled that she carried the matter off very
successfully while she remained.</p>

<p>She spoke cheerfully; she chatted about their
last night&#8217;s experiences; she even laughed over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
some of Aunt Jane&#8217;s sayings&#8211;Aunt Jane was always
a source of much amusement to Mr. Bray.</p>

<p>But the nurse had warned her to be brief, and
soon she was beckoned away. She knew he was
in good hands at the hospital, and that they
would do all that they could for him. But what
the house physician had told her was uppermost
in her mind as she left the institution.</p>

<p>How were they to get to Hillcrest&#8211;and live
after arriving there?</p>

<p>&#8220;If that man paid me twenty dollars for our
furniture, I might have fifty dollars in hand,&#8221;
she thought. &#8220;It will cost us something like two
dollars each for our fares. And then there would
be the freight and baggage, and transportation
for ourselves up to Hillcrest from the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how would it do to bring father to an
old, unheated house&#8211;and so early in the spring?
I guess the doctor didn&#8217;t think about that.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how will we live until it is time for us
to go&#8211;until father is well enough to be moved?
All our little capital will be eaten up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy&#8217;s practical sense then came to her aid.
Saturday night &#8217;Phemie would get through at
the millinery shop. They must not remain dependent
upon Aunt Jane longer than over Sunday.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing to do,&#8221; she decided, &#8220;is for
&#8217;Phemie and me to start for Hillcrest immediately&#8211;on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
Monday morning at the latest. If one of
us has to come back for father when he can be
moved, all right. The cost will not be so great.
Meanwhile we can be getting the old house into
shape to receive him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She found Aunt Jane sitting before her fire,
with a tray of tea and toast beside her, and her
bonnet already set jauntily a-top of her head, the
strings flowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You found that flat in a mess, I&#8217;ll be bound!&#8221;
observed Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>Lydia admitted it. She also told her what
the second-hand man had offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty dollars?&#8221; cried Aunt Jane. &#8220;Take
it, quick, before he has a change of heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Lyddy told her of what the doctor
at the hospital had said about Mr. Bray, and
how they really seemed forced into taking up
with the offer of Hillcrest, the old lady looked
and spoke more seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just as welcome to the use of the
old house, and all you can make out of the farm-crop,
as you can be. I stick to what I told you
last night. But I dunno whether you can really
be comfortable there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out; we&#8217;ll try it,&#8221; returned Lyddy,
bravely. &#8220;Nothing like trying, Aunt Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! there&#8217;s a good many things better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
than trying, sometimes. You&#8217;ve got to have
sense in your trying. If it was me, I wouldn&#8217;t
go to Hillcrest for any money you could name!</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I&#8217;m old and you are
young. I wish I could sell the old place for a
decent sum; but an abandoned farm on the top
of a mountain, with the railroad station six miles
away, ain&#8217;t the kind of property that sells easy
in the real estate market, lemme tell you!</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, there ain&#8217;t much of the two hundred
acres that&#8217;s tillable. Them romantic-looking
rocks that &#8217;Phemie was exclaimin&#8217; over last night,
are jest a nuisance. Humph! the old doctor
used to say there was money going to waste up
there in them rocks, though. I remember hearing
him talk about it once or twice; but jest what
he meant I never knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mineral deposits?&#8221; asked Lyddy, hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not wuth anything. Time an&#8217; agin there&#8217;s
been college professors and such, tappin&#8217; the
rocks all over the farm for &#8216;specimens.&#8217; But
there ain&#8217;t nothing in the line of precious min&#8217;rals
in that heap of rocks at the back of Hillcrest
Farm&#8211;believe me!</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Polly useter say, however, that there was
curative waters there. He used &#8217;em some in his
practise towards the last. But he died suddent,
you know, and nobody ever knew where he got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
the water&#8211;&#8217;nless &#8217;twas Jud Spink. And Jud had
run away with a medicine show years before
father died.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; sighed Aunt Jane. &#8220;If you can find
any way of makin&#8217; a livin&#8217; out of Hillcrest Farm,
you&#8217;re welcome to it. And&#8211;just as that hospital
doctor says&#8211;it may do your father good to live
there for a spell. But <i>me</i>&#8211;it always give me
the fantods, it was that lonesome.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed, as Aunt Jane said, &#8220;a way opened.&#8221;
Yet Lyddy Bray could not see very far ahead.
As she told &#8217;Phemie that night, they could get to
the farm, bag and baggage; but how they would
exist after their arrival was a question not so
easy to answer.</p>

<p>Lyddy had gone to one of the big grocers and
bought and paid for an order of staple groceries
and canned goods which would be delivered at
the railroad station nearest to Hillcrest on Monday
morning. Thus all their possessions could
be carted up to the farm at once.</p>

<p>She had spent the afternoon at the flat collecting
the clothing, bedding, and other articles they
proposed taking with them. These goods she
had taken out by an expressman and shipped by
freight before six o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>In the morning she met the second-hand man
at the ruined flat and he paid her the twenty dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
as promised. And Lyddy was glad to shake
the dust of the Trimble Avenue double-decker
from her feet.</p>

<p>As she turned away from the door she heard
a quick step behind her and an eager voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say! I say! You&#8217;re not moving; are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lydia was exceedingly disturbed. She knew
that boy in the laboratory window had been
watching closely what was going on in the flat.
And now he had <i>dared</i> follow her. She turned
upon him a face of pronounced disapproval.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he stammered.
&#8220;But I hope your father&#8217;s better? Nothing&#8217;s
happened to&#8211;to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to take him away from the
city&#8211;thank you,&#8221; replied Lyddy, impersonally.</p>

<p>She noted with satisfaction that he had run
out without his cap, and in his work-apron. He
could not follow her far in such a rig through
the public streets, that was sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m awful sorry to have you go,&#8221; he said,
stammeringly. &#8220;But I hope it will be beneficial
to your father. I&#8211;I&#8213; You see, my own father
is none too well and we have often talked of his
living out of town somewhere&#8211;not so far but that
I could run out for the week-end, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>Lyddy merely nodded. She would not encourage
him by a single word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;I wish you all kinds of luck!&#8221; exclaimed
the young fellow, finally, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned the very proper Lyddy,
and failed to see his proffered hand, turning
promptly and walking away, not even vouchsafing
him a backward look when she turned the corner,
although she knew very well that he was still
standing, watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He may be a very nice young man,&#8221; thought
Lyddy; &#8220;but, then&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sunday the two girls spent a long hour with
their father. They found him prepared for
the move in prospect for the family&#8211;indeed, he
was cheerful about it. The house physician had
evidently taken time to speak to the invalid about
the change he advised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps by fall I shall be my own self again,
and we can come back to town and all go to
work. We&#8217;ll worry along somehow in the country
for one season, I am sure,&#8221; said Mr. Bray.</p>

<p>But that was what troubled Lyddy more than
anything else. They were all so vague as to
what they should do at Hillcrest&#8211;how they would
be able to live there!</p>

<p>Father said something about when he used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
have a garden in their backyard, and how nice
the fresh vegetables were; and how mother
had once kept hens. But Lyddy could not see
yet how they were to have either a garden or
poultry.</p>

<p>They were all three enthusiastic&#8211;to each
other. And the father was sure that in a fortnight
he would be well enough to travel alone
to Hillcrest; they must not worry about him.
Aunt Jane was to remain in town all that time,
and she promised to report frequently to the girls
regarding their father&#8217;s condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly wish I could help you gals out
with money,&#8221; said the old lady that evening.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the only nieces I&#8217;ve got, and I feel as
kindly towards you as towards anybody in this
wide world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we can get a chance to sell the farm.
If we can, I&#8217;ll help you then with a good, round
sum. Now, then! you fix up the old place and
make it look less like the Wrath o&#8217; Fate had
struck it and maybe some foolish rich man will
come along and want to buy it. If you find a
customer, I&#8217;ll pay you a right fat commission,
girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this was &#8220;all in the offing;&#8221; the Bray
girls were concerned mostly with their immediate
adventures.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>To set forth on this pilgrimage to Hillcrest
Farm&#8211;and alone&#8211;was an event fraught with
many possibilities. Both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie
possessed their share of imagination, despite their
practical characters; and despite the older girl&#8217;s
having gone to college for two years, she, or
&#8217;Phemie, knew little about the world at large.</p>

<p>So they looked forward to Monday morning
as the Great Adventure.</p>

<p>It was a moist, sweet morning, even in the city,
when they betook themselves early to the railway
station, leaving Aunt Jane luxuriously sipping tea
and nibbling toast in bed&#8211;<i>this</i> time with her
nightcap on.</p>

<p>March had come in like a lion; but its lamblike
qualities were now manifest and it really did
seem as though the breath of spring permeated
the atmosphere&#8211;even down here in the smoky,
dirty city. The thought of growing things inspired
&#8217;Phemie to stop at a seed store near the
station and squander a few pennies in sweet-peas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know mother used to put them in just as
soon as she could dig at all in the ground,&#8221; she
told her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ll be a very profitable
crop,&#8221; observed Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
&#8220;let&#8217;s retain a little sentiment, Lyd! We can&#8217;t
eat &#8217;em&#8211;no; but they&#8217;re sweet and restful to look
at. I&#8217;m going to have moon-flowers and morning-glories,
too,&#8221; and she recklessly expended
more pennies for those seeds.</p>

<p>Their train was waiting when they reached
the station and the sisters boarded it in
some excitement. &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s gaiety increased
the nearer they approached to Bridleburg, which
was their goal. She was a plump, rosy girl,
with broad, thick plaits of light-brown hair
(&#8220;molasses-color&#8221; she called it in contempt)
which she had begun to &#8220;do up&#8221; only upon going
to work. She had a quick blue eye, a laughing
mouth, rather wide, but fine; a nose that an
enemy&#8211;had laughing, good-natured Euphemia
Bray owned one&#8211;might have called &#8220;slightly
snubbed,&#8221; and her figure was just coming into
womanhood.</p>

<p>Lydia&#8217;s appearance was entirely different.
They did not look much like sisters, to state the
truth.</p>

<p>The older girl was tall, straight as a dart, with
a dignity of carriage beyond her years, dark hair
that waved very prettily and required little dressing,
and a clear, colorless complexion. Her eyes
were very dark gray, her nose high and well
chiseled, like Aunt Jane&#8217;s. She was more of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
Phelps. Aunt Jane declared Lyddy resembled
Dr. Apollo, or &#8220;Polly,&#8221; Phelps more than had
either of his own children.</p>

<p>The train passed through a dun and sodden
country. The late thaw and the rains had swept
the snow from these lowlands; the unfilled fields
were brown and bare.</p>

<p>Here and there, however, rye and wheat
sprouted green and promising, and in the distance
a hedge of water-maples along the river bank
seemed standing in a purple mist, for their young
leaves were already pushing into the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be pussy-willows,&#8221; exclaimed
&#8217;Phemie, &#8220;and hepaticas in the woods. Think of
<i>that</i>, Lyddy Bray!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the house will be as damp as the tomb&#8211;and
not a stick of wood cut&#8211;and no stoves,&#8221;
returned the older girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, me! you&#8217;re such an old grump!&#8221;
ejaculated &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Why try to cross bridges
before you come to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for you, Miss, that I <i>do</i> think ahead,&#8221;
retorted Lyddy with some sharpness.</p>

<p>There was a grade before the train climbed
into Bridleburg. Back of the straggling old
town the mountain ridge sloped up, a green and
brown wall, breaking the wind from the north
and west, thus partially sheltering the town.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
There was what farmers call &#8220;early land&#8221; about
Bridleburg, and some trucking was carried on.</p>

<p>But the town itself was much behind the times&#8211;being
one of those old-fashioned New England
settlements left uncontaminated by the mill interests
and not yet awakened by the summer
visitor, so rife now in most of the quiet villages
of the six Pilgrim States.</p>

<p>The rambling wooden structure with its long,
unroofed platform, which served Bridleburg as
a station, showed plainly what the railroad company
thought of the town. Many villages of less
population along the line boasted modern station
buildings, grass plots, and hedges. All that surrounded
Bridleburg&#8217;s barrack-like depôt was a
plaza of bare, rolled cinders.</p>

<p>On this were drawn up the two &#8217;buses from
the rival hotels&#8211;the &#8220;New Brick Hotel,&#8221; built
just after the Civil War, and the Eagle House.
Their respective drivers called languidly for customers
as the passengers disembarked from the
train.</p>

<p>Most of these were traveling men, or townspeople.
It was only mid-forenoon and Lyddy
did not wish to spend either time or money at the
local hostelries, so she shook her head firmly at
the &#8217;bus drivers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to get settled by night at Hillcrest&#8211;if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
we can,&#8221; she told &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if
your baggage and freight are here, first of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited until the station agent was at leisure
and learned that all their goods&#8211;a small, one-horse
load&#8211;had arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two girls goin&#8217; up to the old Polly Phelps
house?&#8221; ejaculated the agent, who was a &#8220;native
son&#8221; and knew all about the &#8220;old doctor,&#8221; as
Dr. Apollo Phelps had been known throughout
two counties and on both sides of the mountain
ridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it ain&#8217;t fit for a stray cat to live in, I
don&#8217;t believe&#8211;that house ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;More&#8217;n twenty year since the old doctor died,
and it&#8217;s been shut up ever since.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you his grandchildren? Sho! Mis&#8217;
Bray&#8211;I remember. She was the old doctor&#8217;s
daughter by his secon&#8217; wife. Ya-as.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if I was you, I&#8217;d go to Pritchett&#8217;s house
to stop first. Can&#8217;t be that the old house is fit
to live in, an&#8217; Pritchett is your nighest neighbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; Lyddy said, quietly. &#8220;And
can you tell me whom we could get to transport
our goods&#8211;and ourselves&#8211;to the top of the
ridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? Why! I seen Pritchett&#8217;s long-laiged
boy in town jest now&#8211;Lucas Pritchett. He
ain&#8217;t got away yet,&#8221; responded the station agent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;I ventur&#8217; to say you&#8217;ll find him up Market
Street a piece&#8211;at Birch&#8217;s store, or the post-office.
This train brung in the mail.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s goin&#8217; up light he oughter be willin&#8217;
to help you out cheap. It&#8217;s a six-mile tug, you
know; you wouldn&#8217;t wanter walk it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed up the mountainside. Far, far
toward the summit of the ridge, nestling in a
background of brown and green, was a splash of
vivid white.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Pritchett&#8217;s,&#8221; vouchsafed the station
agent. &#8220;If Dr. Polly Phelps&#8217; house had a coat
of whitewash you could see it, too&#8211;jest to the
right and above Pritchett&#8217;s. Highest house on
the ridge, it is, and a mighty purty site, to my
notion.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>LUCAS PRITCHETT</span></h2>

<p>The Bray girls walked up the village street,
which opened directly out of the square. It
might have been a quarter of a mile in length,
the red brick courthouse facing them at the far
end, flanked by the two hotels. When &#8220;court
sat&#8221; Bridleburg was a livelier town than at present.</p>

<p>On either hand were alternately rows of one,
or two-story &#8220;blocks&#8221; of stores and offices, or
roomy old homesteads set in the midst of their
own wide, terraced lawns.</p>

<p>There were a few pleasant-looking people on
the walks and most of these turned again to look
curiously after the Bray girls. Strangers&#8211;save
in court week&#8211;were a novelty in Bridleburg, that
was sure.</p>

<p>Market Street was wide and maple-shaded.
Here and there before the stores were &#8220;hitching
racks&#8221;&#8211;long wooden bars with iron rings set
every few feet&#8211;to which a few horses, or teams,
were hitched. Many of the vehicles were buckboards,
much appreciated in the hill country; but
there were farm wagons, as well. It was for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
one of these latter the Bray girls were in search.
The station agent had described Lucas Pritchett&#8217;s
rig.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; gasped the quick-eyed &#8217;Phemie,
&#8220;Oh, Lyd! <i>do</i> look at those ponies. They&#8217;re as
ragged-looking as an old cowhide trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that wagon,&#8221; sighed Lyddy. &#8220;Shall
we ride in it? We&#8217;ll be a sight going through
the village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better wait and see if he&#8217;ll take us,&#8221;
remarked &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;But I should worry about
what people here think of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke a lanky fellow, with a lean and sallow
face, lounged out of the post-office and across
the walk to the heads of the disreputable-looking
ponies. He wore a long snuff-colored overcoat
that might have been in the family for two or
three generations, and his overalls were stuck into
the tops of leg-boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Lucas&#8211;sure,&#8221; whispered &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>But she hung back, just the same, and let her
sister do the talking. And the first effect of
Lyddy&#8217;s speech upon Lucas Pritchett was most
disconcerting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning!&#8221; Lyddy said, smiling upon
the lanky young farmer. &#8220;You are Mr. Lucas
Pritchett, I presume?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no audible reply, although his lips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
moved and they saw his very prominent Adam&#8217;s
apple rise and fall convulsively. A wave of red
suddenly washed up over his face like a big
breaker rolling up a sea-beach; and each individual
freckle at once took on a vividness of
aspect that was fairly startling to the beholder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> Mr. Pritchett?&#8221; repeated Lyddy,
hearing a sudden half-strangled giggle from
&#8217;Phemie, who was behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as&#8211;I be,&#8221; finally acknowledged the bashful
Lucas, that Adam&#8217;s apple going up and down
again like the slide on a trombone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going home without much of a load;
aren&#8217;t you, Mr. Pritchett?&#8221; pursued Lyddy, with
a glance into the empty wagon-body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as&#8211;I be,&#8221; repeated Lucas, with another
gulp, trying to look at both girls at once and succeeding
only in looking cross-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to be your nearest neighbors,
Mr. Pritchett,&#8221; said Lyddy, briskly. &#8220;Our
aunt, Mrs. Hammond, has loaned us Hillcrest to
live in and we have our baggage and some other
things at the railway station to be carted up to
the house. Will you take it&#8211;and us? And
how much will you charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas just gasped&#8211;&#8217;Phemie declared afterward,
&#8220;like a dying fish.&#8221; This was altogether too
much for Lucas to grasp at once; but he had followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
Lyddy up to a certain point. He held
forth a broad, grimed, calloused palm, and faintly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217;s nieces? Do tell!
Maw&#8217;ll be pleased to see ye&#8211;an&#8217; so&#8217;ll Sairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook hands solemnly with Lyddy and then
with &#8217;Phemie, who flashed him but a single glance
from her laughing eyes. The &#8220;Italian sunset
effect,&#8221; as &#8217;Phemie dubbed Lucas&#8217;s blushes, began
to fade out of his countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you take us home with you?&#8221; asked
Lyddy, impatient to settle the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I surely can,&#8221; exclaimed Lucas. &#8220;You hop
right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We want to know what you will charge
first&#8211;for us and the things at the depôt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a big load; air they?&#8221; queried Lucas,
doubtfully. &#8220;You know the hill&#8217;s some steep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy enumerated the packages, Lucas checking
them off with nods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We kin take &#8217;em all. You
hop in&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie was pulling the skirt of her sister&#8217;s
jacket and Lyddy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We have some errands to do. We&#8217;ll
meet you up the street. That is your way
home?&#8221; and she indicated the far end of Market
Street.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>&#8220;Ya-as.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will you charge us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more&#8217;n a dollar, Miss,&#8221; he said, grinning.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ax ye nothin&#8217;; but this is dad&#8217;s team
and when I git a job like this he allus expects his
halvings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Pritchett. We&#8217;ll pay you a
dollar,&#8221; agreed Lyddy, in her sedate way. &#8220;And
we&#8217;ll meet you up the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas unhitched the ponies and stepped into
the wagon. When he turned them and gave them
their heads the ragged little beasts showed that
they were a good deal like the proverbial singed
cat&#8211;far better than they looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you didn&#8217;t care what people thought
of you here?&#8221; observed Lyddy to her sister, as
the wagon went rattling down the street. &#8220;Yet
it seems you don&#8217;t wish to ride through Bridleburg
in Mr. Pritchett&#8217;s wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, breathless
from giggling. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the wagon. But
<i>he&#8217;s</i> a freak, Lyd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a face? And those
freckles!&#8221; went on the girl, heedless of her sister&#8217;s
admonishing voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody may hear you,&#8221; urged Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;And repeat what you say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>that</i> should worry me!&#8221; returned &#8217;Phemie,
gaily. &#8220;Oh, dear, Lyd! don&#8217;t be a grump.
This is all a great, big joke&#8211;the people and all.
And Lucas is certainly the capsheaf. Did you
ever in your life before even imagine such a
freak?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lyddy would not join in her hilarity.</p>

<p>&#8220;These country people may seem peculiar to us,
who come fresh from the city,&#8221; she said, with some
gravity. &#8220;But I wonder if we don&#8217;t appear quite
as &#8216;queer&#8217; and &#8216;green&#8217; to them as they do
to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Hurry on,
Lyd. Don&#8217;t let him overtake us before we get to
the edge of town.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed the courthouse and waited for
Lucas and the farm wagon on the outskirts of
the village&#8211;where the more detached houses gave
place to open fields. No plow had been put into
these lower fields as yet; still, the coming spring
had breathed upon the landscape and already the
banks by the wayside were turning green.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie became enthusiastic at once and before
Lucas hove in view, evidently anxiously looking
for them, the younger girl had gathered a great
bunch of early flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re mighty purty,&#8221; commented the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
farmer, as the girls climbed over the wheel with
their muddy boots and all.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie, giggling, took her seat on the other
side of him. She had given one look at the awkwardly
arranged load on the wagon-body and at
once became helpless with suppressed laughter.
If the girls she had worked with in the millinery
store for the last few months could see them and
their &#8220;lares and penates&#8221; perched upon this farm
wagon, with this son of Jehu for a driver!</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you expect to stay a spell?&#8221; said
Lucas, with a significant glance from the conglomerate
load to Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;we hope to,&#8221; replied the oldest Bray
girl. &#8220;Do you think the house is in very bad
shape inside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. We never go in it, Miss,&#8221;
responded Lucas, shaking his head. &#8220;Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217;
never left us the key&#8211;not to upstairs. Dad&#8217;s
stored cider and vinegar in the cellar under the
east ell for sev&#8217;ral years. It&#8217;s a better cellar&#8217;n
we&#8217;ve got.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I dunno what dad&#8217;ll say,&#8221; he added, &#8220;to
your goin&#8217; up there to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he got to do with it?&#8221; asked &#8217;Phemie,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we work the farm on shares an&#8217; we was
calc&#8217;latin&#8217; to do so this year.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>&#8220;Our living in the house doesn&#8217;t interfere with
that arrangement,&#8221; said Lyddy, quietly. &#8220;Aunt
Jane told us all about that. I have a letter from
her for your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw&#8211;well,&#8221; commented Lucas, slowly.</p>

<p>The ponies had begun to mount the rise in
earnest now. They tugged eagerly at the load,
and trotted on the level stretches as though tireless.
Lyddy commented upon this, and Lucas
flushed with delight at her praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re hill-bred, they be,&#8221; he said, proudly.
&#8220;Tackle &#8217;em to a buggy, or a light cart, an&#8217; up
hill or down hill means the same to &#8217;em. They
won&#8217;t break their trot.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it comes plowin&#8217; time we clip &#8217;em, an&#8217;
then they don&#8217;t look so bad in harness,&#8221; confided
the young fellow. &#8220;If&#8211;if you like, I&#8217;ll take
you drivin&#8217; over the hills some day&#8211;when the
roads git settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; responded Lyddy, non-committally.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie giggled &#8220;How nice!&#8221; and watched
the red flow into the young fellow&#8217;s face with
wicked appreciation.</p>

<p>The roads certainly had not &#8220;settled&#8221; after the
winter frosts, if this one they were now climbing
was a proper sample. &#8217;Phemie and Lyddy held
on with both hands to the smooth board which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
served for a seat to the springless wagon&#8211;and
they were being bumped about in a most exciting
way.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie began to wonder if Lucas was not
quite as much amused by their unfamiliarity with
this method of transportation as she was by his
bashfulness and awkward manners. Lyddy fairly
wailed, at last:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha&#8211;what a dread&#8211;dreadful ro-o-o-ad!&#8221;
and she seized Lucas suddenly by the arm nearest
to her and frankly held on, while the forward
wheel on her side bounced into the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this ain&#8217;t bad for a mountain road,&#8221; the
young farmer declared, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; squealed &#8217;Phemie, the wheel on her
side suddenly sinking into a deep rut, so that she
slid to the extreme end of the board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better ketch holt on me, Miss,&#8221; advised
Lucas, crooking the arm nearest &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;You
city folks ain&#8217;t useter this kind of travelin&#8217;, I can
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie refused, unwilling to be &#8220;beholden&#8221;
to him, and the very next moment the
ponies clattered over a culvert, through which the
brown flood of a mountain stream spurted in such
volume that the pool below the road was both
deep and angry-looking.</p>

<p>There was a washout gullied in the road here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
Down went the wheel on &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s side, and with
the lurch the young girl lost her insecure hold upon
the plank.</p>

<p>With a screech she toppled over, plunging sideways
from the wagon-seat, and as the hard-bitted
ponies swept on &#8217;Phemie dived into the foam-streaked
pool!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>NEIGHBORS</span></h2>

<p>Lucas Pritchett was not as slow as he
seemed.</p>

<p>In one motion he drew in the plunging ponies
to a dead stop, thrust the lines into Lyddy&#8217;s hands,
and vaulted over the wheel of the farm wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold &#8217;em!&#8221; he commanded, pulling off the
long, snuff-colored overcoat. Flinging it behind
him he tore down the bank and, in his high boots,
waded right into the stream.</p>

<p>Poor &#8217;Phemie was beyond her depth, although
she rose &#8220;right side up&#8221; when she came to the
surface. And when Lucas seized her she had
sense enough not to struggle much.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;The wa&#8211;water
is s-so cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet ye it is!&#8221; agreed the young fellow, and
gathering her right up into his arms, saturated as
her clothing was, he bore her to the bank and
clambered to where Lyddy was doing all she could
to hold the restive ponies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa, Spot and Daybright!&#8221; commanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
the young farmer, soothing the ponies much
quicker than he could his human burden. &#8220;Now,
Miss, you&#8217;re all right&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All r-r-right!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, her teeth
chattering like castanets. &#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;m anything <i>but</i>
right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Phemie! you might have been drowned,&#8221;
cried her anxious sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now I&#8217;m likely to be frozen stiff right
here in this road. Mrs. Lot wasn&#8217;t a circumstance
to me. She only turned to salt, while I am
be-be-coming a pillar of ice!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lucas had set her firmly on her feet, and
now he snatched up the old overcoat which had
so much amused &#8217;Phemie, and wrapped it about
her, covering her from neck to heel.</p>

<p>&#8220;In you go&#8211;sit &#8217;twixt your sister and me this
time,&#8221; panted the young man. &#8220;We&#8217;ll hustle
home an&#8217; maw&#8217;ll git you &#8217;twixt blankets in a
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get her death!&#8221; moaned Lyddy, holding
the coat close about the wet girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! We&#8217;ll travel some now,&#8221; exclaimed
Lucas, leaping in, and having seized the
reins, he shook them over the backs of the ponies
and shouted to them.</p>

<p>The remainder of that ride up the mountain
was merely a nightmare for the girls. Lucas allowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
the ponies to lose no time, despite the load
they drew. But haste was imperative.</p>

<p>A ducking in an icy mountain brook at this time
of the year might easily be fraught with serious
consequences. Although it was drawing toward
noon and the sun was now shining, there was no
great amount of warmth in the air. Lucas must
have felt the keen wind himself, for he was wet,
too; but he neither shivered nor complained.</p>

<p>Luckily they were well up the mountainside
when the accident occurred. The ponies flew
around a bend where a grove of trees had shut
off the view, and there lay the Pritchett house and
outbuildings, fresh in their coat of whitewash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maw and Sairy&#8217;ll see to ye now,&#8221; cried Lucas,
as he neatly clipped the gatepost with one hub
and brought the lathered ponies to an abrupt stop
in the yard beside the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, Maw!&#8221; he added, as a very stout woman
appeared in the doorway&#8211;quite filling the opening,
in fact. &#8220;Hi, Maw! Here&#8217;s Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217;s
nieces&#8211;an&#8217; one of &#8217;em&#8217;s been in Pounder&#8217;s
Brook!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake!&#8221; gasped the farmer&#8217;s
wife, pulling a pair of steel-bowed spectacles down
from her brows that she might peer through them
at the Bray girls. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t it a mite airly for sech
didoes as them?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;Why, Maw!&#8221; sputtered Lucas, growing red
again. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t <i>go</i> for to do it&#8211;no,
ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al! I didn&#8217;t know. City folks is funny.
But come in&#8211;do! Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217;s nieces, d&#8217;ye
say? Then you must be John Horrocks Bray&#8217;s
gals&#8211;ain&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are,&#8221; said Lyddy, who had quickly
climbed out over the wheel and now eased down
the clumsy bundle which was her sister. &#8220;Can
you stand, &#8217;Phemie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es,&#8221; chattered her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you can take us in for a little while,
Mrs. Pritchett,&#8221; went on the older girl. &#8220;We
are going up to Hillcrest to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take ye in? Sure! An&#8217; &#8217;twon&#8217;t be the first
city folks we&#8217;ve harbored,&#8221; declared the lady,
chuckling comfortably. &#8220;They&#8217;re beginnin&#8217; to
come as thick as spatters in summer to Bridleburg,
an&#8217; some of &#8217;em git clear up this
way&#8213; For the land&#8217;s sake! that gal&#8217;s as wet
as sop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8211;it was wet water I tumbled into,&#8221; stuttered
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett ushered them into the big, warm
kitchen, where the table was already set for dinner.
A young woman&#8211;not so <i>very</i> young, either&#8211;as
lank and lean as Lucas himself, was busy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
at the stove. She turned to stare at the visitors
with near-sighted eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my darter, Sairy,&#8221; said &#8220;Maw&#8221;
Pritchett. &#8220;She taught school two terms to
Pounder&#8217;s school; but it was bad for her eyes.
I tell her to git specs; but she &#8217;lows she&#8217;s too
young for sech things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The oculists advise glasses nowadays for very
young persons,&#8221; observed Lyddy politely, as Sairy
Pritchett bobbed her head at them in greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I tell her,&#8221; declared the farmer&#8217;s wife.
&#8220;But she won&#8217;t listen to reason. Ye know how
young gals air!&#8221;</p>

<p>This assumption of Sairy&#8217;s extreme youth, and
that Lyddy would understand her foibles because
she was so much older, amused the latter immensely.
Sairy was about thirty-five.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Pritchett bustled about with
remarkable spryness to make &#8217;Phemie comfortable.
There was a warm bedroom right off the
kitchen&#8211;for this was an old-fashioned New England
farmhouse&#8211;and in this the younger Bray
girl took off her wet clothing. Lyddy brought
in their bag and &#8217;Phemie managed to make herself
dry and tidy&#8211;all but her great plaits of hair&#8211;in
a very short time.</p>

<p>She would not listen to Mrs. Pritchett&#8217;s advice
that she go to bed. But she swallowed a bowl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
of hot tea and then declared herself &#8220;as good as
new.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bray girls had now to tell Mrs. Pritchett
and her daughter their reason for coming to Hillcrest,
and what they hoped to do there.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake!&#8221; gasped the farmer&#8217;s
wife. &#8220;I dunno what Cyrus&#8217;ll say to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>It struck Lyddy that they all seemed to be
somewhat in fear of what Mr. Pritchett might
say. He seemed to be a good deal of a &#8220;bogie&#8221;
in the family.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not interfere with Mr. Pritchett&#8217;s
original arrangement with Aunt Jane,&#8221; exclaimed
Lyddy, patiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ye&#8217;ll hafter talk to Cyrus when he
comes in to dinner,&#8221; said the farmer&#8217;s wife. &#8220;I
dunno how he&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We</i> should worry about how he &#8216;takes it,&#8217;&#8221;
commented &#8217;Phemie in Lyddy&#8217;s ear. &#8220;I guess
we&#8217;ve got the keys to Hillcrest and Aunt Jane&#8217;s
permission to live in the house and make what
we can off the place. What more is there to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the older Bray girl caught a glimpse of
Cyrus Pritchett as he came up the path from the
stables, and she saw that he was nothing at all
like his rotund and jolly wife&#8211;not in outward
appearance, at least.</p>

<p>The Pritchett children got their extreme height
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
from Cyrus&#8211;and their leanness. He was a grizzled
man, whose head stooped forward because
he was so tall, and who looked fiercely on the
world from under penthouse brows.</p>

<p>Every feature of his countenance was grim and
forbidding. His cheeks were gray, with a stubble
of grizzled beard upon them. When he came
in and was introduced to the visitors he merely
grunted an acknowledgment of their names and
immediately dropped into his seat at the head of
the table.</p>

<p>As the others came flocking about the board,
Cyrus Pritchett opened his lips just once, and not
until the grace had been uttered did the visitors
understand that it was meant for a reverence
before meat.</p>

<p>&#8220;For wha&#8217; we&#8217;re &#8217;bout to r&#8217;ceive make us tru&#8217;
grat&#8217;ful&#8211;pass the butter, Sairy,&#8221; and the old man
helped himself generously and began at once to
stow the provender away without regard to the
need or comfort of the others about his board.</p>

<p>But Maw Pritchett and her son and daughter
seemed to be used to the old man&#8217;s way, and they
helped each other and the Bray girls with no niggard
hand. Nor did the shuttle of conversation
lag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I ain&#8217;t been in the old doctor&#8217;s house
since he died,&#8221; said Mrs. Pritchett, reflectively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
&#8220;Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217;, she&#8217;s been up here two or three
times, an&#8217; she allus goes up an&#8217; looks things over;
but I&#8217;m too fat for walkin&#8217; up to Hillcrest&#8211;I be,&#8221;
concluded the lady, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>She seemed as jolly and full of fun as her
husband was morose. Cyrus Pritchett only glowered
on the Bray girls when he looked at them
at all.</p>

<p>But Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie joined in the conversation
with the rest of the family. &#8217;Phemie, although
she had made so much fun of Lucas at
first, now made amends by declaring him to be a
hero&#8211;and sticking to it!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never have got out of that pool if it
hadn&#8217;t been for Lucas,&#8221; she repeated; &#8220;unless I
could have drunk up the water and walked ashore
that way! And o-o-oh! wasn&#8217;t it cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope you&#8217;re not going to feel the effects of
it later,&#8221; said her sister, still anxious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; assured the confident &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno as it&#8217;ll be fit for you gals to stay
in the old house to-night,&#8221; urged Mrs. Pritchett.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll hafter have some wood cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that when I take their stuff up to Hillcrest,&#8221;
said Lucas, eagerly, but flushing again as
though stricken with a sudden fever.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are no stoves in the house, I suppose?&#8221;
Lyddy asked, wistfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>&#8220;Bless ye! Dr. Polly wouldn&#8217;t never have a
stove in his house, saving a cook-stove in the
kitchen, an&#8217; of course, that&#8217;s ate up with rust
afore this,&#8221; exclaimed the farmer&#8217;s wife. &#8220;He
said open fireplaces assured every room its proper
ventilation. He didn&#8217;t believe in these new-fangled
ways of shuttin&#8217; up chimbleys. My! but
he was powerful sot on fresh air an&#8217; sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Onct,&#8221; pursued Mrs. Pritchett, &#8220;he was
called to see Mis&#8217; Fibbetts&#8211;she that was a widder
and lived on &#8217;tother side of the ridge, on the
road to Adams. She had a mis&#8217;ry of some kind,
and was abed with all the winders of her room
tight closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Open them winders,&#8217; says Dr. Polly to the
neighbor what was a-nussin&#8217; of Mis&#8217; Fibbetts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Next time he come the winders was down
again. Dr. Polly warn&#8217;t no gentle man, an&#8217; he
swore hard, he did. He flung up the winders
himself, an&#8217; stamped out o&#8217; the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was right keen weather,&#8221; chuckled Mrs.
Pritchett, her double chins shaking with enjoyment,
&#8220;and Mis&#8217; Fibbetts was scart to death of
a leetle air. Minute Dr. Polly was out o&#8217; sight
she made the neighbor woman shet the winders
ag&#8217;in.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when Dr. Polly turned up the ridge road
he craned out&#8217;n the buggy an&#8217; he seen the winders
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
shet. He jerked his old boss aroun&#8217;, drove back
to the house, stalked into the sick woman&#8217;s room,
cane in hand, and smashed every pane of glass in
them winders, one after another.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now I reckon ye&#8217;ll git air enough to cure
ye &#8217;fore ye git them mended,&#8217; says he, and marched
him out again. An&#8217; sure &#8217;nough old Mis&#8217; Fibbetts
got well an&#8217; lived ten year after. But she
never had a good word for Dr. Polly Phelps, jest
the same,&#8221; chuckled the narrator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll make out somehow about fires,&#8221;
said Lyddy, cheerfully, &#8220;if Lucas can cut us
enough wood to keep them going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure can,&#8221; declared the ever-ready youth,
and just here Cyrus Pritchett, having eaten his
fill, broke in upon the conversation in a tone that
quite startled Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie Bray.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanter know what ye mean to do up there
on the old Polly Phelps place?&#8221; he asked, pushing
back his chair, having set down his coffee-cup
noisily, and wiped his cuff across his lips. &#8220;I
gotta oral contract with Jane Hammon&#8217; to work
that farm. It&#8217;s been in force year arter year for
more&#8217;n ten good year. An&#8217; that contract ain&#8217;t
to be busted so easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Father!&#8221; admonished Mrs. Pritchett;
but the old man glared at her and she at once
subsided.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>Cyrus Pritchett certainly was a masterful man
in his own household. Lucas dropped his gaze
to his plate and his face flamed again. But Sairy
turned actually pale.</p>

<p>Somehow the cross old man did not make
Lyddy Bray tremble. She only felt angry that
he should be such a bully in his own home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you read Aunt Jane&#8217;s letter, Mr.
Pritchett,&#8221; she said, taking it from her handbag
and laying it before the farmer.</p>

<p>The old man grunted and slit the flap of the
envelope with his greasy tableknife. He drew
his brows down into even a deeper scowl as he
read.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she turns her part of the contract over to
you two chits of gals; does she?&#8221; said Mr. Pritchett,
at last. &#8220;Humph! I don&#8217;t think much of
that, now I tell ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pritchett,&#8221; said Lyddy, firmly, &#8220;if you
don&#8217;t care to work the farm for us on half shares,
as you have heretofore with Aunt Jane, pray say
so. I assure you we will not be offended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;ll you do then?&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you refuse to put in a crop for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get some other neighboring farmer to do
so,&#8221; replied Lyddy, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you will, eh?&#8221; growled Cyrus Pritchett,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
sitting forward and resting his big hands on his
knees, while he glared like an angry dog at the
slight girl before him.</p>

<p>The kitchen was quite still save for his booming
voice. The family was evidently afraid of
the old man&#8217;s outbursts of temper.</p>

<p>But Lyddy Bray&#8217;s courage rose with her indignation.
This cross old farmer was a mere
bully after all, and there was never a bully yet
who was not a moral coward!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pritchett,&#8221; she told him, calmly, &#8220;you
cannot frighten me by shouting at me. I may as
well tell you right now that the crops you have
raised for Aunt Jane of late years have not been
satisfactory. We expect a better crop this year,
and if you do not wish to put it in, some other
neighbor will.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a good time to decide the matter.
What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>HILLCREST</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett and Sairy really were frightened
by Lyddy Bray&#8217;s temerity. As for Lucas, he
still hung his head and would not look at his
father.</p>

<p>Cyrus Pritchett had bullied his family so long
that to be bearded in his own house certainly
amazed him. He glared at the girl for fully a
minute, without being able to formulate any reply.
Then he burst out with:</p>

<p>&#8220;You let me ketch any other man on this ridge
puttin&#8217; a plow inter the old doctor&#8217;s land! I&#8217;ve
tilled it for years, I tell ye&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can till it again, Mr. Pritchett,&#8221; said
Lyddy, softly. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t holler so about it&#8211;we
all hear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coolness of the girl silenced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, now it&#8217;s understood,&#8221; she went on, smiling
at him brightly. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll try this year to make
a little better crop. We really must get something
more out of it than the taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Hammon&#8217; won&#8217;t buy no fertilizer,&#8221;
growled Mr. Pritchett, put on the defensive&#8211;though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
he couldn&#8217;t tell why. &#8220;An&#8217; ye can&#8217;t
grow corn on run-down land without potash an&#8217;
kainit, and the like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you shall tell us all about that later,&#8221;
declared Lyddy, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll see. I understand
that you can&#8217;t get blood from a turnip. We
want to put Hillcrest in better shape&#8211;both in
and out of the house&#8211;and then there&#8217;ll be a
better chance to sell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cyrus Pritchett&#8217;s eyes suddenly twinkled with
a shrewd light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Jane Hammon&#8217; really want to sell the
farm?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she gets a good offer,&#8221; replied Lyddy.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what we hope to do while we&#8217;re at Hillcrest&#8211;make
the place more valuable and more
attractive to the possible buyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; grunted Cyrus, sneeringly. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
get a fancy price for Hillcrest&#8211;not!&#8221;</p>

<p>But that ended the discussion. &#8220;Maw&#8221;
Pritchett looked on in wonder. She had seen her
husband beaten in an argument by a &#8220;chit of a
girl&#8221;&#8211;and really, Cyrus did not seem to be very
ugly, or put out about it, either!</p>

<p>He told Lucas to put the ponies to the wagon
again, and to take the Bray girls and their belongings
up to Hillcrest; and to see that they were
comfortable for the night before he came back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>This encouraged Mrs. Pritchett, when Lyddy
took out her purse to pay for their entertainment,
to declare:</p>

<p>&#8220;For the good land, no! We ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
charge ye for a meal of vittles&#8211;and you gals Dr.
Polly Phelps&#8217;s own grandchildren! B&#8217;sides, we want
ye to be neighborly. It&#8217;s nice for Sairy to have
young companions, too. I tell her she&#8217;ll git to
be a reg&#8217;lar old maid if she don&#8217;t &#8217;sociate more
with gals of her own age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sairy bridled and blushed at this. But she
wasn&#8217;t an unkind girl, and she helped &#8217;Phemie
gather their possessions&#8211;especially the latter&#8217;s
wet clothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I wish ye joy up there at the old
house,&#8221; said Sairy, with a shudder. &#8220;But ye
wouldn&#8217;t ketch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch you doing what?&#8221; asked &#8217;Phemie, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stayin&#8217; in Dr. Phelps&#8217;s old house over night,&#8221;
explained Sairy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s daughter drew close to &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
ear and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ha&#8217;nted!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ghosts,&#8221; exclaimed Sairy, in a thrilling voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
&#8220;All old houses is ha&#8217;nted. And that&#8217;s been give
up to ghosts for years an&#8217; years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, goody!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie, clasping
her hands and almost dancing in delight. &#8220;Do
you mean it&#8217;s a really, truly haunted house?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sairy Pritchett gazed at her with slack jaw
and round eyes for a minute. Then she sniffed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al!&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;I re&#8217;lly thought
you was <i>bright</i>. But I see ye ain&#8217;t got any too
much sense, after all,&#8221; and forthwith refused to
say anything more to &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>But the younger Bray girl decided to say
nothing about the supposed ghostly occupants of
Hillcrest to her sister&#8211;for the present, at least.</p>

<p>There was still half a mile of road to climb
to Hillcrest, for the way was more winding than
it had been below; and as the girls viewed the
summit of the ridge behind Aunt Jane&#8217;s old farm
they saw that the heaped-up rocks were far more
rugged than romantic, after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two hundred acres of it,&#8221; Lucas observed,
chirruping to the ponies. &#8220;But more&#8217;n
a hundred is little more&#8217;n rocks. And even the
timber growin&#8217; among &#8217;em ain&#8217;t wuth the cuttin&#8217;.
Ye couldn&#8217;t draw it out. There&#8217;s firewood
enough on the place, and a-plenty! But that&#8217;s
&#8217;bout all&#8211;&#8217;nless ye wanted to cut fence rails, or
posts.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>&#8220;What are those trees at one side, near the
house?&#8221; queried Lyddy, interestedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old orchard. <i>There&#8217;s</i> your nearest firewood.
Ain&#8217;t been much fruit there since I can
remember. All run down.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, indeed, Hillcrest looked to be, as they
approached it, a typical run-down farm. Tall,
dry weed-stalks clashed a welcome to them from
the fence corners as the ponies turned into the
lane from the public road. The sun had drawn
a veil of cloud across his face and the wind
moaned in the gaunt branches of the beech trees
that fringed the lane.</p>

<p>The house was set upon a knoll, with a crumbling,
roofed porch around the front and sides.
There were trees, but they were not planted near
enough to the house to break the view on every
side but one of the sloping, green and brown
mountainside, falling away in terraced fields,
patches of forest, tablelands of rich, tillable soil,
and bush-cluttered pastures, down into the shadowy
valley, through which the river and the railroad
wound.</p>

<p>Behind Hillcrest, beyond the outbuildings, and
across the narrow, poverty-stricken fields, were
the battlements of rock, shutting out all view but
that of the sky.</p>

<p>Lonely it was, as Aunt Jane had declared; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
to the youthful eyes of the Bray girls the outlook
was beautiful beyond compare!</p>

<p>&#8220;Our land jines this farm down yonder a
piece,&#8221; explained Lucas, drawing in the ponies
beside the old house. &#8220;Ye ain&#8217;t got nobody behind
ye till ye git over the top of the ridge. Your
line follers the road on this side, and on the other
side of the road is Eben Brewster&#8217;s stock farm of
a thousand acres&#8211;mostly bush-parsture an&#8217; rocks,
up this a-way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were but momentarily interested in
the outlook, however. It was the old house itself
which their bright eyes scanned more particularly
as they climbed down from the wagon.</p>

<p>There were two wings, or &#8220;ells.&#8221; In the west
wing was the kitchen and evidently both sitting
and sleeping rooms, upstairs and down&#8211;enough
to serve all their present needs. Aunt Jane had
told them that there were, altogether, twenty-two
rooms in the old house.</p>

<p>Lucas hitched his horses and then began to lift
down their luggage. Lyddy led the way to the
side door, of which she had the key.</p>

<p>The lower windows were defended by tight
board shutters, all about the house. The old
house had been well guarded from the depredations
of casual wayfarers. Had tramps passed
this way the possible plunder in the old house had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
promised to be too bulky to attract them; and
such wanderers could have slept as warmly in
the outbuildings.</p>

<p>Lyddy inserted the key and, after some trouble,
for the lock was rusty, turned it. There was an
ancient brass latch, and she lifted it and pushed
the door open.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! isn&#8217;t it dark&#8211;and musty,&#8221; the older
sister said, hesitating on the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome to the ghosts of Hillcrest,&#8221; spoke
&#8217;Phemie, in a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>She had not been afraid of Cyrus Pritchett, but
&#8217;Phemie&#8217;s irreverence for the spirits of the old
house shocked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; laughed the younger girl. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
cut out the ghosts, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We most certainly <i>will</i>. If I met a ghost
here I&#8217;d certainly cut him dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie went forward boldly and opened the
door leading into the big kitchen. It was gloomy
there, too, for the shutters kept out most of the
light. The girls could see, however, that it was
a well-furnished room. They were delighted,
too, for this must be their living-room until they
could set the house to rights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dust, dust everywhere,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie, making
a long mark in it with her finger on the dresser.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>&#8220;But <i>only</i> dust. We can get cleaned up here
all right by evening. Come! unhook the shutters
and let in the light of day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger girl raised one of the small-paned
window sashes, unbolted the shutter, and pushed
both leaves open. The light streamed in and
almost at once Lucas&#8217;s head appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it look to ye&#8211;eh?&#8221; he asked,
grinning. &#8220;Gee! the hearth&#8217;s all cleared and
somebody&#8217;s had a fire here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been a long time ago,&#8221; returned
Lyddy, noting the crusted ashes between the andirons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; said Lucas, slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll git to
work with the axe an&#8217; soon start ye a fire there,
B-r-r-r! it&#8217;s cold as a dog&#8217;s nose in there,&#8221; and he
disappeared again.</p>

<p>But the sunlight and air which soon flooded the
room through all the windows quickly gave the
long-shut-up kitchen a new atmosphere.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie already had on a working dress, having
changed at the Pritchett house after her unfortunate
ducking; Lyddy soon laid aside her own better
frock, too.</p>

<p>Then they found their bundle of brooms and
brushes, and set to work. There was a pump on
the back porch and a well in the yard. During
all these empty years the leather valve of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
pump had rotted away; but Lucas brought them
water from the well.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kin git the shoemaker in town to cut ye out
a new leather,&#8221; said the young farmer. &#8220;He&#8217;s
got a pattern. An&#8217; I can put it in for ye. The
pump&#8217;ll be a sight handier than the well for you
two gals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t he a nice boy?&#8221; demanded Lyddy
of her sister. &#8220;And you called him a freak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub it in, Lyd,&#8221; snapped &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;But it is hard to have to accept a veritable gawk
of a fellow like Lucas&#8211;for that&#8217;s what he <i>is</i>!&#8211;as
a sure-enough hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was said aside, of course, and while Lucas
was doing yeoman&#8217;s work at the woodpile. He
had brought in a huge backlog, placed it carefully,
laid a forestick and the kindling, and soon blue
and yellow flames were weaving through the well-built
structure of the fire. There was a swinging
crane for the kettle and a long bar with hooks
upon it, from which various cooking pots could
dangle. Built into the chimney, too, was a brick
oven with a sheet-iron door. The girls thought
all these old-fashioned arrangements delightful,
whether they proved convenient, or not.</p>

<p>They swept and dusted the old kitchen
thoroughly, and cleaned the cupboards and pantry-closet.
Then they turned their attention to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
half bedchamber, half sitting-room that opened
directly out of the kitchen. In these two rooms
they proposed to live at first&#8211;until their father
could join them, at least.</p>

<p>There was an old-time high, four-post bed in
this second room. It had been built long before
some smart man had invented springs, and
its frame was laced from side to side, and up
and down, like the warp and woof of a rug,
with a &#8220;bedrope&#8221; long since rotted and moth-eaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie,
laughing. &#8220;That will never hold you and me,
Lyd. We&#8217;ll just have to stuff that old tick
with hay and sleep on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lucas heard their discussion and again
came to their help. Lyddy had bought a new
clothesline when she purchased her food supplies
at the city department store, and the clever Lucas
quickly roped the old bedstead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy certainly is rising by leaps and
bounds in my estimation,&#8221; admitted &#8217;Phemie, in
a whisper, to her sister.</p>

<p>Then came the problem of the bed. Lyddy
had saved their pillows from the wreck of the
flat; but the mattresses had gone with the furniture
to the second-hand man. There might be
good feather beds in the farmhouse attic; Aunt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
Jane had said something about them, Lyddy believed.
But there was no time to hunt for these
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a tick,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie said again.
&#8220;What&#8217;ll we fill it with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to me,&#8221; volunteered Lucas. &#8220;One
of the stable lofts is half full of rye straw. We
thrashed some rye on this place last year. It&#8217;s
jest as good beddin&#8217; for humans as it is for cattle,
I declare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;We&#8217;ll bed
down like the cows for a while. I don&#8217;t see anything
better to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But really, by sunset, they were nearly to rights
and the prospect for a comfortable first night at
Hillcrest was good.</p>

<p>Lucas&#8217;s huge fire warmed both the kitchen and
the bedroom, despite the fact that the evening
promised to be chilly, with the wind mourning
about the old house and rattling the shutters.
The girls closed the blinds, made all cozy, and
bade young Pritchett good-night.</p>

<p>Lyddy had paid him the promised dollar for
transporting their goods, and another half-dollar
for the work he had done about the house
that afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll come up in the mornin&#8217; an&#8217; bring ye
the milk an&#8217; eggs maw promised ye,&#8221; said Lucas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
as he drove away, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll cut ye some more
wood then.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was already a great heap of sticks beside
the hearth, and in the porch another windrow,
sheltered from any possible storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in luck to have such good neighbors,&#8221;
sighed Lyddy, as the farm wagon rattled away.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! but we&#8217;re going to have good times
here,&#8221; declared &#8217;Phemie, coming into the house
after her and closing and locking the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long way off from everybody else,&#8221;
observed the older sister, in a doubtful tone.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t believe we shall be disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have
supper. I&#8217;m starved to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swung the blackened old tea-kettle over the
blaze, and moved briskly about the room laying
the cloth, while Lyddy got out crackers and cheese
and opened a tin of meat before she brewed the
comforting cup of tea that both girls wanted.</p>

<p>However, they <i>were</i> alone&#8211;half a mile from
the nearest habitation&#8211;and if nothing else, they
could not help secretly comparing their loneliness
with the tenement in the city from which they
had so recently graduated.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WHISPER IN THE DARK</span></h2>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was very bold&#8211;until something really
scared her&#8211;and then she was quite likely to lose
her head altogether. Lyddy was timid by nature,
but an emergency forced her courage to high
pressure.</p>

<p>They both, however, tried to ignore the fact
that they were alone in the old house, far up on
the mountainside, and a considerable distance
from any neighbor.</p>

<p>That was why they chattered so all through
supper&#8211;and afterward. Neither girl cared to
let silence fall upon the room.</p>

<p>The singing of the kettle on the crane was a
blessing. It made music that drove away &#8220;that
lonesome feeling.&#8221; And when it actually bubbled
over and the drip of it fell hissing into the fire,
&#8217;Phemie laughed as though it were a great joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a jolly thing as an open fire is, I declare,&#8221;
she said, sitting down at last in one of the
low, splint-bottomed chairs, when the supper
dishes were put away. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame Grandfather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
Phelps for refusing to allow stoves to be
put up in his day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy it would take a deal of wood to heat
the old house in real cold weather,&#8221; Lyddy said.
&#8220;But it <i>is</i> cheerful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woo-oo! woo-oo-oo!&#8221; moaned the wind
around the corner of the house. A ghostly hand
rattled a shutter. Then a shrill whistle in the
chimney startled them.</p>

<p>At such times the sisters talked all the faster&#8211;and
louder. It was really quite remarkable
how much they found to say to each other.</p>

<p>They wondered how father was getting along
at the hospital, and if Aunt Jane would surely
see him every day or two, and write them. Then
they exchanged comments upon what they had
seen of Bridleburg, and finally fell back upon the
Pritchetts as a topic of conversation&#8211;and that
family seemed an unfailing source of suggestion
until finally &#8217;Phemie jumped up, declaring:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of this, Lyd? Let&#8217;s go to
bed. We&#8217;re both half scared to death, but we&#8217;ll
be no worse off in bed&#8213;And, b-r-r-r! the fire&#8217;s
going down.&#8221;</p>

<p>They banked the fire as Lucas had advised
them, put out the lamp, and retired with the
candle to the bedroom. The straw mattress
rustled as though it were full of mice, when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
sisters had said their prayers and climbed into
bed. &#8217;Phemie blew out the candle; but she had
laid matches near it on the high stand beside her
pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope there <i>are</i> feather beds in the garret,&#8221;
she murmured, drowsily. &#8220;This old straw is <i>so</i>
scratchy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look to-morrow,&#8221; Lyddy said. &#8220;Aunt
Jane said we could make use of anything we
found here. But, my! it&#8217;s a big house for only
three people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; admitted &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;I&#8217;d feel a whole
lot better if it was full of folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy, suddenly.
&#8220;We might take boarders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Summer boarders?&#8221; asked her sister, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I s&#8217;pose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a long way ahead. It&#8217;s winter yet,&#8221;
and &#8217;Phemie snuggled down into her pillow.
&#8220;Folks from the city would never want to come
to an old house like this&#8211;with so few conveniences
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We</i> like it; don&#8217;t we?&#8221; demanded Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether we do yet, or not,&#8221;
replied &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s wait and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was drowsy, yet somehow she couldn&#8217;t
fall asleep. Usually she was the first of the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
to do so; but to-night Lyddy&#8217;s deeper breathing
assured the younger sister that she alone was awake
in all the great, empty house.</p>

<p>And Sairy Pritchett had intimated that Hillcrest
was haunted!</p>

<p>Now, &#8217;Phemie didn&#8217;t believe in ghosts&#8211;not at
all. She would have been very angry had anyone
suggested that there was a superstitious strain
in her character.</p>

<p>Yet, as she lay there beside her sleeping sister
she began to hear the strangest sounds.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the wind; nor was it the low crackling
of the fire on the kitchen hearth. She could easily
distinguish both of these. Soon, too, she made
out the insistent gnawing of a rat behind the mopboard.
That long-tailed gentleman seemed determined
to get in; but &#8217;Phemie was not afraid of
rats. At least, not so long as they kept out of
sight.</p>

<p>But there were other noises. Once &#8217;Phemie
had all but lost herself in sleep when&#8211;it seemed&#8211;a
voice spoke directly in her ear. It said:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I thought I&#8217;d find you here.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie started into a sitting posture in the
rustling straw bed. She listened hard.</p>

<p>The voice was silent. The fire was still. The
wind had suddenly dropped. Even the rat had
ceased his sapping and mining operations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>What had frightened Mr. Rat away?</p>

<p>He, too, must have heard that mysterious voice.
&#8217;Phemie could not believe she had imagined it.</p>

<p>Was that a rustling sound? Were those distant
steps she heard&#8211;somewhere in the house? Did
she hear a door creak?</p>

<p>She slipped out of bed, drew on her woollen
wrapper and thrust her feet into slippers. She
saw that it was bright moonlight outside, for a
pencil of light came through a chink in one of
the shutters.</p>

<p>Lyddy slept as calmly as a baby&#8211;and &#8217;Phemie
was glad. Of course, it was all foolishness about
ghosts; but she believed there was somebody
prowling about the house.</p>

<p>She lit the candle and after the flame had sputtered
a bit and began to burn clear she carried it
into the kitchen. Their little round alarm clock
ticked modestly on the dresser. It was not yet
ten o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the &#8216;witching hour of midnight, when
graveyards yawn&#8217;&#8211;and other people do, too,&#8221;
thought &#8217;Phemie, giggling nervously. &#8220;Surely
ghosts cannot be walking yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, she was quite assured that what she
had heard&#8211;both the voice and the footsteps&#8211;were
very much of the earth, earthy. There was
nothing supernatural in the mysterious sounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>And it seemed to &#8217;Phemie as though the steps
had retreated toward the east ell&#8211;the other wing
of the rambling old farmhouse.</p>

<p>What was it Lucas Pritchett had said about his
father using the cellar under the east wing at Hillcrest?
Yet, what would bring Cyrus Pritchett&#8211;or
anybody else&#8211;up here to the vinegar cellar at
ten o&#8217;clock at night?</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie grew braver by the minute. She determined
to run this mystery down, and she was
quite sure that it would prove to be a very human
and commonplace mystery after all. She opened
the door between the kitchen and the dark side
hall by which they had first entered the old house
that afternoon. Although she had never been
this way, &#8217;Phemie knew that out of this square
hall opened a long passage leading through the
main house to the east wing.</p>

<p>And she easily found the door giving entrance
to this corridor. But she hesitated when she
stood on the threshold, and almost gave up the
venture altogether.</p>

<p>A cold, damp breath rushed out at her&#8211;just
as though some huge, subterranean monster lay
in wait for her in the darkness&#8211;a darkness so
dense that the feeble ray of her candle could only
penetrate it a very little way.</p>

<p>&#8220;How foolish of me!&#8221; murmured &#8217;Phemie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve come so far&#8211;I guess I can see it
through.&#8221;</p>

<p>She certainly did not believe that the steps and
voice were inside the house. The passage was
empty before her. She refused to let the rising
tide of trepidation wash away her self-control.</p>

<p>So she stepped in boldly, holding the candle
high, and proceeded along the corridor. There
were tightly closed doors on either side, and behind
each door was a mystery. She could not
help but feel this. Every door was a menace to
her peace of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will <i>not</i> think of such things,&#8221; she told
herself. &#8220;I know if there <i>is</i> anybody about the
house, it is a very human somebody indeed&#8211;and
he has no business here at this time of night!&#8221;</p>

<p>In her bed-slippers &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s light feet fell
softly on the frayed oilcloth that carpeted the
long hall. Dimly she saw two or three heavy,
ancient pieces of furniture standing about&#8211;a tall
escritoire with three paneled mirrors, which reflected
herself and her candle dimly; a long davenport
with hungry arms and the dust lying thick
upon its haircloth upholstery; chairs with highly
ornate spindles in their perfectly &#8220;straight up and
down,&#8221; uncomfortable-looking backs.</p>

<p>She came to the end of the hall. A door faced
her which she was sure must lead into the east
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
wing. There, Aunt Jane had said, old Dr. Polly
Phelps had had his office, consultation room, and
workshop, or laboratory. &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s hand hesitated
on the latch.</p>

<p>Should she venture into the old doctor&#8217;s rooms?
The greater part of his long and useful life had
been spent behind this green-painted door.
&#8217;Phemie, of course, had never seen her grandfather;
but she had seen his picture&#8211;that of a
tall, pink-faced, full-bodied man, his cheeks and
lips cleanly shaven, but with a fringe of silvery
beard under his chin, and long hair.</p>

<p>It seemed to her for a moment as though, if she
opened this door, the apparition of the old doctor,
just as he was in his picture, would be there to face
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little fool!&#8221; whispered the shaken
&#8217;Phemie to herself. &#8220;Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted the latch. The door seemed to
stick. She pressed her knee against the panel;
it did not give at all.</p>

<p>And then she discovered that the door was
locked. But the key was there, and in a moment
she turned it creakingly and pushed the door open.</p>

<p>The air in the corridor had been still; but suddenly
a strong breeze drew this green door wide
open. The wind rushed past, blew out the candle,
and behind her the other door, which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
had left ajar, banged heavily, echoing and reechoing
through the empty house.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was startled, but she understood at
once the snuffing of her candle and the closing of
the other door. She only hoped Lyddy would
not be frightened by the noise&#8211;or by her absence
from her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see it through, just the same,&#8221; declared
the girl, her teeth set firmly on her lower lip.
&#8220;Ha! driven away by a draught&#8211;not I!&#8221;</p>

<p>She groped her way into the room and closed
the green door. There was a match upon her
candlestick and she again lighted the taper.
Quickly the first room in this east wing suite was
revealed to her gaze.</p>

<p>This had been the anteroom, or waiting-room
for the old doctor&#8217;s patients. There was a door
opening on the side porch. A long, old-fashioned
settee stood against one wall, and some splint-bottomed
chairs were set stiffly about the room,
while a shaky mahogany table, with one pedestal
leg, occupied the center of the apartment.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was more careful of the candle now
and shielded the flame with her hollowed palm
as she pushed open the door of the adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Here was a big desk with a high top and drop
lid, while there were rows upon rows of drawers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
underneath. A wide-armed chair stood before the
desk, just as it must have been used by the old
doctor. The room was lined to the ceiling with
cases of books and cupboards. Nobody had disturbed
the doctor&#8217;s possessions after his death.
No younger physician had &#8220;taken over&#8221; his practice.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie went near enough to see that the desk,
and the cupboards as well, were locked. There
was a long case standing like an overgrown clock-case
in one corner. The candle-light was reflected
in the front of this case as though the door was
a mirror.</p>

<p>But when &#8217;Phemie approached it she saw that
it was merely a glass door with a curtain of
black cambric hung behind it. She was curious
to know what was in the case. It had no lock
and key and she stretched forth a tentative hand
and turned the old-fashioned button which held
it closed.</p>

<p>The door seemed fairly to spring open, as
though pushed from within, and, as it swung outward
and the flickering candle-light penetrated its
interior, &#8217;Phemie heard a sudden surprising sound.</p>

<p>Somewhere&#8211;behind her, above, below, in the
air, all about her&#8211;was a sigh! Nay, it was
more than a sigh; it was a mighty and unmistakable
yawn!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>And on the heels of this yawn a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting mighty tired of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie flashed her gaze back to the open case.
Fear held her by the throat and choked back the
shriek she would have been glad to utter. For,
dangling there in the case, its eyeless skull on a
level with her own face, hung an articulated skeleton;
and to &#8217;Phemie Bray&#8217;s excited comprehension
it seemed as though both the yawn and the apt
speech which followed it, had proceeded from the
grinning jaws of the skull!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>MORNING AT HILLCREST</span></h2>

<p>The bang of the door, closed by the draught
when &#8217;Phemie had opened the way into the east
wing, <i>had</i> aroused Lyddy. She came to herself&#8211;to
a consciousness of her strange surroundings&#8211;with
a sharpness of apprehension that set
every nerve in her body to tingling.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Phemie! what is it?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Then, rolling over on the rustling straw mattress,
she reached for her sister&#8217;s hand. But
&#8217;Phemie was not there.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Phemie!&#8221; Lyddy cried loudly, sitting
straight up in bed. She knew she was alone in
the room, and hopped out of bed, shivering. She
groped for her robe and her slippers. Then
she sped swiftly into the kitchen.</p>

<p>She knew where the lamp and the match-box
were. Quickly she had the lamp a-light and then
swept the big room with a startled glance.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie had disappeared. The outside door
was still locked. It seemed to Lyddy as though
the echoing slam of the door that had awakened
her was still ringing in her ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>She ran to the hall door and opened it. Dark&#8211;and
not a sound!</p>

<p>Where could &#8217;Phemie have gone?</p>

<p>The older sister had never known &#8217;Phemie to
walk in her sleep. She had no tricks of somnambulism
that Lyddy knew anything about.</p>

<p>And yet the older Bray girl was quite sure her
sister had come this way. The lamplight, when
the door was opened wide, illuminated the square
hall quite well. Lyddy ran across it and pushed
open the door of the long corridor.</p>

<p>There was no light in it, yet she could see outlined
the huge pieces of furniture, and the ugly
chairs. And at the very moment she opened this
door, the door at the far end was flung wide and
a white figure plunged toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Phemie!&#8221; screamed the older sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyddy!&#8221; wailed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>And in a moment they were in each other&#8217;s
arms and Lyddy was dragging &#8217;Phemie across the
entrance hall into the lighted kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? What <i>is</i> it?&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; was all &#8217;Phemie was able to say
for the moment; then, as she realized how really
terrified her sister was, she continued her series
of &#8220;ohs&#8221; while she thought very quickly.</p>

<p>She knew very well what had scared her; but
why add to Lyddy&#8217;s fright? She could not explain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
away the voice she had heard. Of course,
she knew very well it had <i>not</i> proceeded from the
skeleton. But why terrify Lyddy by saying anything
about that awful thing?</p>

<p>&#8220;What scared you so?&#8221; repeated Lyddy, shaking
her a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; stammered &#8217;Phemie&#8211;and
she didn&#8217;t!</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you get up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard something&#8211;voices&#8211;people
talking&#8211;steps,&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, and now her
teeth began to chatter so that she could scarcely
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foolish girl!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy, rapidly recovering
her own self-control. &#8220;You dreamed
it. And now you&#8217;ve got a chill, wandering
through this old house. Here! sit down there!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drove her into a low chair beside the
hearth. She ran for an extra comforter to wrap
around her. She raked the ashes off the coals of
the fire, and set the tea-kettle right down upon
the glowing bed.</p>

<p>In a minute it began to steam and gurgle, and
Lyddy made her sister an old-fashioned brew of
ginger tea. When the younger girl had swallowed
half a bowlful of the scalding mixture she
ceased shaking. And by that time, too, she had
quite recovered her self-control.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a very foolish little girl,&#8221; declared
Lyddy, warningly, &#8220;to get up alone and go wandering
about this house. Why, <i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t do it
for&#8211;for the whole farm!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I dropped my candle. It went out,&#8221; said
&#8217;Phemie, quietly. &#8220;I guess being in the dark
scared me more than anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s enough. Forget it! We&#8217;ll go
to bed again and see if we can&#8217;t get some sleep.
Why! it&#8217;s past eleven.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the sisters crept into bed again, and lay in
each other&#8217;s arms, whispering a bit and finally,
before either of them knew it, they were asleep.
And neither ghosts, nor whispering voices, nor
any other midnight sounds disturbed their slumbers
for the remainder of that first night at Hillcrest.</p>

<p>They were awake betimes&#8211;and without the
help of the alarm clock. It was pretty cold in
the two rooms; but they threw kindling on the
coals and soon the flames were playing tag through
the interlacing sticks that &#8217;Phemie heaped upon
the fire.</p>

<p>The kettle was soon bubbling again, while
Lyddy mixed batter cakes. A little bed of live
coals was raked together in front of the main
fire and on this a well greased griddle was set,
where the cakes baked to a tender brown and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
were skillfully lifted off by &#8217;Phemie and buttered
and sugared.</p>

<p>What if a black coal or two <i>did</i> snap over the
cakes? And what if &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s hair <i>did</i> get
smoked and &#8220;smelly?&#8221; Both girls declared
cooking before an open fire to be great fun. They
had yet, however, to learn a lot about &#8220;how our
foremothers cooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t for the life of me see how they ever
used that brick oven,&#8221; said Lyddy, pointing to
the door in the side of the chimney. &#8220;Surely,
that hole in the bricks would never heat from
<i>this</i> fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask Lucas,&#8221; advised &#8217;Phemie, and as though
in answer to that word, Lucas himself appeared,
bearing offerings of milk, eggs, and new bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he said, in a gratified tone, sniffing
in the doorway. &#8220;I told maw you two
gals wouldn&#8217;t go hungry. Ye air a sight too
clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Lucas,&#8221; said Lyddy, demurely.
&#8220;Will you have a cup of tea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m. I&#8217;ve had my breakfast. It&#8217;s seven
now and I&#8217;ll go right t&#8217; work cutting wood for
ye. That&#8217;s what ye&#8217;ll want most, I reckon. And
I want to git ye a pile ready, for it won&#8217;t be many
days before we start plowin&#8217;, an&#8217; then dad won&#8217;t
hear to me workin&#8217; away from home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>Lyddy went out of doors for a moment and
spoke to him from the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do too much trimming in the orchard,
Lucas, till I have a look at the trees. I have a
book about the care of an old orchard, and perhaps
I can make something out of this one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of other wood handy, Miss Lyddy,&#8221;
declared the lanky young fellow. &#8220;And it&#8217;ll
be easier to split than apple and peach wood,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie, meanwhile, had said she would run in
and find the candle she had dropped in her fright
the night before; but in truth it was more for the
purpose of seeing the east wing of the old house
by daylight&#8211;and that skeleton.</p>

<p>&#8220;No need for Lyddy to come in here and have
a conniption fit, too,&#8221; thought the younger sister,
&#8220;through coming unexpectedly upon that Thing
in the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, my gracious! he might just as well have
been the author of that mysterious speech I heard.
I should think he <i>would</i> be tired of staying shut
up in that box,&#8221; pursued the girl, giggling nervously,
as she stood before the open case in which
the horrid thing dangled.</p>

<p>Light enough came through the cracks in the
closed shutters to reveal to her the rooms that the
old doctor had so long occupied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>&#8217;Phemie closed the skeleton case and picked up
her candle. Then she continued her investigation
of the suite to the third room. Here were
shelves and work-benches littered with a heterogeneous
collection of bottles, tubes, retorts, filters,
and other things of which &#8217;Phemie did not even
know the names or uses.</p>

<p>There was a door, too, that opened directly
into the back yard. But this door was locked
and double-bolted. She was sure that the person,
or persons, whom she had heard talking the
night before had not been in this room. When
she withdrew from the east wing she locked
the green-painted door as she had found it; but
in addition, she removed the key and hid it where
she was sure nobody but herself would be likely
to find it.</p>

<p>Later she tackled Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8211;or any of your folks&#8211;were
up here last night, Lucas?&#8221; she asked the
young farmer, out of her sister&#8217;s hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, Miss? I should say not!&#8221; replied the
surprised Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I heard voices around the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell!&#8221; exclaimed he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would be likely to come here at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never heard the beat o&#8217; that,&#8221; declared
Lucas. &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;Sh! don&#8217;t let my sister hear,&#8221; whispered
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;She heard nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Air you sure&#8213;&#8221; began Lucas, but at that
the young girl snapped him up quick enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am confident I even heard some things they
said. They were men. It sounded as though
they spoke over there by the east wing&#8211;<i>or in the
cellar</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; exclaimed the wondering
Lucas, leading the way slowly to the cellar-hatch
just under the windows of the old doctor&#8217;s
workshop.</p>

<p>This hatch was fastened by a big brass padlock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s got the key to that,&#8221; said Lucas. &#8220;Jest
like I told you, we have stored vinegar in it, some.
Ain&#8217;t many barrels left at this time o&#8217; year. Dad
sells off as he can during the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, of course, your father didn&#8217;t come up
here last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shucks! O&#8217; course not,&#8221; replied the young
farmer. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t no vinegar buyer around in this
neighborhood now&#8211;an&#8217; &#8217;specially not at night.
Dad ain&#8217;t much for goin&#8217; out in the evenin&#8217;, nohow.
He does sit up an&#8217; read arter we&#8217;re all
gone to bed sometimes. But it couldn&#8217;t be dad
you heard up here&#8211;no, Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the puzzle remained a puzzle. However,
the Bray girls had so much to do, and so much to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
think of that, after all, the mystery of the night
occupied a very small part of &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>Lyddy had something&#8211;and a very important
something, she thought&#8211;on her mind. It had
risen naturally out of the talk the girls had had
when they first went to bed the evening before.
&#8217;Phemie had wished for a houseful of company
to make Hillcrest less lonely; the older sister had
seized upon the idea as a practical suggestion.</p>

<p>Why not fill the big house&#8211;if they could?
Why not enter the lists in the land-wide struggle
for summer boarders?</p>

<p>Of course, if Aunt Jane would approve.</p>

<p>First of all, however, Lyddy wanted to see the
house&#8211;the chambers upstairs especially; and she
proposed to her sister, when their morning&#8217;s work
was done, that they make a tour of discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead on,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie replied, eagerly. &#8220;I hope
we find a softer bed than that straw mattress&#8211;and
one that won&#8217;t tickle so! Aunt Jane said
we could do just as we pleased with things here;
didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Within reason,&#8221; agreed Lyddy. &#8220;And that&#8217;s
all very well up to a certain point, I fancy. But
I guess Aunt Jane doesn&#8217;t expect us to make use
of the whole house. We will probably find this
west wing roomy enough for our needs, even when
father comes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>They ventured first up the stairs leading to the
rooms in this wing. There were two nice ones
here and a wide hall with windows overlooking
the slope of the mountainside toward Bridleburg.
They could see for miles the winding road up
which they had climbed the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, this wing will do very nicely for <i>us</i>,&#8221;
Lyddy said, thinking aloud. &#8220;We can make that
room downstairs where we&#8217;re sleeping, our sitting-room
when it comes warm weather; and that will
give us all the rest of the house&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All but the old doctor&#8217;s offices,&#8221; suggested
&#8217;Phemie, doubtfully. &#8220;There are three of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; returned Lyddy, &#8220;three and four are
seven; and seven from twenty-two leaves fifteen.
Some of the first-floor rooms we&#8217;ll have to use
as dining and sitting-rooms for the boarders&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; exclaimed her sister,
again breaking in upon her ruminations. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got the house full of boarders already; have you?
What will Aunt Jane say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we&#8217;ll find out. But there ought to be
at least twelve rooms to let. If there&#8217;s as much
furniture and stuff in all as there is in these&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how&#8217;ll we ever get the boarders? And
how&#8217;d we cook for &#8217;em over that open fire? It&#8217;s
ridiculous!&#8221; declared &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;<i>That</i> is yet to be proved,&#8221; returned her sister,
unruffled.</p>

<p>They pursued their investigation through the
second-floor rooms. There were eight of them
in the main part of the house and two in the east
wing over the old doctor&#8217;s offices. The last two
were only partially furnished and had been used
in their grandfather&#8217;s day more for &#8220;lumber
rooms&#8221; than aught else. It was evident that Dr.
Phelps had demanded quiet and freedom in his
own particular wing of Hillcrest.</p>

<p>But the eight rooms in the main part of the
house on this second floor were all of good size,
well lighted, and completely furnished. Some
of them had probably not been slept in for fifty
years, for when the girls&#8217; mother, and even Aunt
Jane, were young, Dr. Apollo Phelps&#8217;s immediate
family was not a large one.</p>

<p>&#8220;The furniture is all old-fashioned, it is true,&#8221;
Lyddy said, reflectively. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t a metal
bed in the whole house&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I had just as lief sleep in a coffin as in
some of these high-headed carved walnut bedsteads,&#8221;
declared &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to sleep in them,&#8221; responded
her sister, quietly. &#8220;But some people would
think it a privilege to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can have <i>my</i> share, and no charge,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
sniffed the younger girl. &#8220;That bed downstairs
is bad enough. And what would we do for mattresses?
That&#8217;s <i>one</i> antique they wouldn&#8217;t stand
for&#8211;believe me! Straw beds, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that. We might get some
cheap elastic-felt mattresses, one at a time, as we
needed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And springs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the bedsteads are roped like the one
we sleep on. Others have old-fashioned spiral
springs&#8211;and there are no better made to-day.
The rust can be cleaned off and they can be
painted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see plainly you&#8217;re laying out a lot of work
for us,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve got to work to live,&#8221; responded
her sister, briskly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as,&#8221; drawled &#8217;Phemie, in imitation of
Lucas Pritchett. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to feel as
though I was just living to work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lazybones!&#8221; laughed Lyddy. &#8220;You know,
if we really got started in this game&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A game; is it? Keeping boarders!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy it&#8217;s downright hard work,&#8221; quoth
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it makes us independent? If it will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
keep poor father out of the shop? If it can be
made to support us?&#8221; cried Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie flushed suddenly and her eyes sparkled.
She seized her more sedate sister and danced her
about the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care how hard I work if it&#8217;ll do
all that!&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;Come on, Lyd! Let&#8217;s
write to Aunt Jane right away.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VENTURE</span></h2>

<p>But Lyddy Bray never made up her mind in
a hurry. Perhaps she was inclined to err on the
side of caution.</p>

<p>Whereas &#8217;Phemie eagerly accepted a new thing,
was enthusiastic about it for a time, and then tired
of it unless she got &#8220;her second wind,&#8221; as she
herself laughingly admitted, Lyddy would talk
over a project a long time before she really decided
to act upon it.</p>

<p>It was so in this case. Once having seen the
vista of possibilities that Lyddy&#8217;s plan revealed,
the younger girl was eager to plunge into the
summer-boarder project at once. But Lyddy
was determined to know just what they had to
work with, and just what they would need, before
broaching the plan to Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>So she insisted upon giving a more than cursory
examination to each of the eight chambers on this
second floor. Some of the pieces of old furniture
needed mending; but most of the mending could
be done with a pot of glue and a little ingenuity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
Furthermore, a can of prepared varnish and some
linseed oil and alcohol would give most of the
well-made and age-darkened furniture the gloss it
needed.</p>

<p>There were old-style stone-china toilet sets in
profusion, and plenty of mirrors, while there was
closet room galore. The main lack, as &#8217;Phemie
had pointed out, was in the mattress line.</p>

<p>But when the girls climbed to the garret floor
they found one finished room there&#8211;a very good
sleeping-room indeed&#8211;and on the bedstead in this
room were stacked, one on top of another, at least
a dozen feather beds.</p>

<p>Each bed was wrapped in sheets of tarred paper&#8211;hermetically
sealed from moths or other insect life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for goodness sake, Lyd!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie,
&#8220;let&#8217;s take one of these to sleep on. There are
pillows, too; but we&#8217;ve got <i>them</i>. Say! we can
put one of these beds on top of the straw tick
and be in comfort at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But the feather bed would be
pretty warm for summer use,&#8221; sighed Lyddy, as
she helped her sister lift down one of the
beds&#8211;priceless treasures of the old-time housewife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Country folk&#8211;some of them&#8211;sleep on
feathers the year &#8217;round,&#8221; proclaimed &#8217;Phemie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
&#8220;Perhaps your summer boarders can be educated
up to it&#8211;or <i>down</i> to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll try the &#8216;down&#8217; and see how it
works,&#8221; agreed Lyddy. &#8220;My! these feathers
are pressed as flat as a pancake. The bed must
go out into the sun and air and be tossed once
in a while, so that the air will get through it,
before there&#8217;ll be any &#8216;life&#8217; in these feathers.
Now, don&#8217;t try to do it all, &#8217;Phemie. I&#8217;ll help
you downstairs with it in a minute. I just want
to look into the big garret while we&#8217;re up here.
Dear me! isn&#8217;t it dusty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an attractive-looking assortment of chests,
trunks, old presses, boxes, chests of drawers, decrepit
furniture, and the like as was set about that
garret! There was no end of old clothing hanging
from the rafters, too&#8211;a forest of garments
that would have delighted an old clo&#8217; man;
but&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oo! Oo! Ooo!&#8221; hooted &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Look
at the spider webs. Why, I wouldn&#8217;t touch those
things for the whole farm. I bet there are fat
old spiders up there as big as silver dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we can keep away from that corner,&#8221;
said Lyddy, with a shudder. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want old
coats and hats. But I wonder what <i>is</i> in those
drawers. We shall want bed linen if we go
into the business of keeping boarders.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>She tried to open some of the nearest presses
and bureaus, but all were locked. So, rather
dusty and disheveled, they retired to the floor
below, between them managing to carry the
feather bed out upon the porch where the sun
could shine upon it.</p>

<p>At noon Lyddy &#8220;buzzed&#8221; Lucas, as &#8217;Phemie
called it, about the way folk in the neighborhood
cooked with an open fire, and especially about
the use of the brick oven that was built into the
side of the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;That air contraption,&#8221; confessed the young
farmer, &#8220;ain&#8217;t much more real use than a fifth
leg on a caow&#8211;for a fac&#8217;. But old folks used
&#8217;em. My grandmaw did.</p>

<p>&#8220;She useter shovel live coals inter the oven
an&#8217; build a reg&#8217;lar fire on the oven bottom. Arter
it was het right up she&#8217;d sweep aout the brands
and ashes with long-handled brushes, an&#8217; then set
the bread, an&#8217; pies, an&#8217; Injun puddin&#8217; an&#8217; the like&#8211;sometimes
the beanpot, too&#8211;on the oven floor.
Ye see, them bricks will hold heat a long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But lemme tell ye,&#8221; continued Lucas, shaking
his head, &#8220;it took the <i>know how</i>, I reckon, ter
bake stuff right by sech means. My maw never
could do it. She says either her bread would be
all crust, or &#8217;twas raw in the middle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; pursued Lucas, &#8220;these &#8217;ere what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
they call &#8216;Dutch ovens&#8217; ain&#8217;t so bad. I kin remember
before dad bought maw the stove, she
used a Dutch oven&#8211;an&#8217; she&#8217;s got it yet. I know
she&#8217;d lend it to you gals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s real nice of you, Lucas,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie,
briskly. &#8220;But what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a big sheet-iron pan with a tight
cover. You set it right in the coals and shovel
coals on top of it and all around it. Things bake
purty good in a Dutch oven&#8211;ya-as&#8217;m! Beans
never taste so good to my notion as they useter
when maw baked &#8217;em in the old Dutch oven. An&#8217;
dad says they was &#8217;nough sight better when <i>he</i>
was a boy an&#8217; grandmaw baked &#8217;em in an oven
like that one there,&#8221; and Lucas nodded at the
closet in the chimney that &#8217;Phemie had opened to
peer into.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye see, it&#8217;s the slow, steady heat that don&#8217;t
die down till mornin&#8217;&#8211;that&#8217;s what bakes beans
nice,&#8221; declared this Yankee epicure.</p>

<p>Lucas had a &#8220;knack&#8221; with the axe, and he cut
and piled enough wood to last the girls at least
a fortnight. Lyddy felt as though she could not
afford to hire him more than that one day at
present; but he was going to town next day
and he promised to bring back a pump leather
and some few other necessities that the girls
needed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>Before he went home Lucas got &#8217;Phemie off to
one side and managed to stammer:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you gals air scart&#8211;or the like o&#8217; that&#8211;you
jest say so an&#8217; I&#8217;ll keep watch around here
for a night or two, an&#8217; see if I kin ketch the
fellers you heard talkin&#8217; last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lucas! I wouldn&#8217;t trouble you for the
world,&#8221; returned &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Lucas&#8217;s countenance was a wonderful lobster-like
red, and he was so bashful that his eyes fairly
watered.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be no trouble, Miss &#8217;Phemie,&#8221; he
told her. &#8220;&#8217;Twould be a pleasure&#8211;it re&#8217;lly
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what would folks say?&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie,
her eyes dancing. &#8220;What would your sister and
mother say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They needn&#8217;t know a thing about it,&#8221; declared
Lucas, eagerly. &#8220;I&#8211;I could slip out o&#8217;
my winder an&#8217; down the shed ruff, an&#8217; sneak up
here with my shot-gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Pritchett! I believe you are in
the habit of doing such things. I am afraid you
get out that way often, and the family knows
nothing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, I don&#8217;t&#8211;only circus days, an&#8217; w&#8217;en the
Wild West show comes, an&#8217;&#8211;an&#8217; Fourth of July
mornin&#8217;s. But don&#8217;t you tell; will yer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;Cross my heart!&#8221; promised &#8217;Phemie, giggling.
&#8220;But suppose you should shoot somebody around
here with that gun?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarve &#8217;em aout jest right!&#8221; declared the
young farmer, boldly. &#8220;B&#8217;sides, I&#8217;d only load
it with rock-salt. &#8217;Twould pepper &#8217;em some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Salt and pepper &#8217;em, Lucas,&#8221; giggled the
girl. &#8220;And season &#8217;em right, I expect, for breaking
our rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; declared Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; threatened &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas was swamped in his own confusion again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless I tell you you may,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie,
smiling on him dazzlingly once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see if we are disturbed again,&#8221;
spoke the girl, more kindly. &#8220;I really am
obliged to you, Lucas; but I couldn&#8217;t hear of your
watching under our windows these cold nights&#8211;and,
of course, it wouldn&#8217;t be proper for us to
let you stay in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; agreed the disappointed youth.
&#8220;But if ye need me, ye&#8217;ll let me know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure pop!&#8221; she told him, and was only sorry
when he was gone that she could not tell Lyddy
all about it, and give her older sister &#8220;an imitation&#8221;
of Lucas as a cavalier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>The girls wrote the letter to Aunt Jane that
evening and the next morning they watched for
the rural mail-carrier, who came along the highroad,
past the end of their lane, before noon.</p>

<p>He brought a letter from Aunt Jane for Lyddy,
and he was ready to stop and gossip with the
girls who had so recently come to Hillcrest Farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see some life about the old doctor&#8217;s
house again,&#8221; declared the man. &#8220;I can
remember Dr. Polly&#8211;everybody called him that&#8211;right
well. He was a queer customer some
ways&#8211;brusk, and sort of rough. But he was a
good deal like a chestnut burr. His outside was
his worst side. He didn&#8217;t have no soothing bedside
mannerisms; but if a feller was real <i>sick</i>, it
was a new lease of life to jest have the old doctor
come inter the room!&#8221;</p>

<p>It made the girls happy and proud to have
people speak this way of their grandfather.</p>

<p>&#8220;He warn&#8217;t a man who didn&#8217;t make enemies,&#8221;
ruminated the mail-carrier. &#8220;He was too strong
a man not to be well hated in certain quarters.
He warn&#8217;t pussy-footed. What he meant he said
out square and straight, an&#8217; when he put his foot
down he put it down emphatic. Yes, sir!</p>

<p>&#8220;But he had a sight more friends than enemies
when he died. And lots o&#8217; folks that thought
they hated Dr. Polly could look back&#8211;when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
was dead and gone&#8211;an&#8217; see how he&#8217;d done &#8217;em
many a kind turn unbeknownst to &#8217;em at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; rambled on the mail-carrier, &#8220;I was
talkin&#8217; to Jud Spink in Birch&#8217;s store only las&#8217;
night. Jud ain&#8217;t been &#8217;round here for some time
before, an&#8217; suthin&#8217; started talk about the old doctor.
Jud, of course, sailed inter him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked &#8217;Phemie, trying to appear interested,
while Lyddy swiftly read her letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon you two gals&#8211;bein&#8217; only granddaughters
of the old doctor&#8211;never heard much
about Jud Spink&#8211;Lemuel Judson Spink he calls
hisself now, an&#8217; puts a &#8216;professor&#8217; in front of his
name, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a professor?&#8221; asked &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. He&#8217;s been a good many things.
Injun doctor&#8211;actor&#8211;medicine show fakir&#8211;patent
medicine pedlar; and now he owns &#8216;Diamond
Grits&#8217;&#8211;the greatest food on airth, <i>he</i>
claims, an&#8217; I tell him it&#8217;s great all right, for man
<i>an&#8217;</i> beast!&#8221; and the mail-carrier went off into a
spasm of laughter over his own joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Diamond Grits is a breakfast food,&#8221; chuckled
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Do you s&#8217;pose horses would eat it,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine will,&#8221; said the mail-carrier. &#8220;Jud
sent me a case of Grits and I fed most of it to
this critter. Sassige an&#8217; buckwheats satisfy me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
better of a mornin&#8217;, an&#8217; I dunno as this hoss has
re&#8217;lly been in as good shape since I give it the
Grits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wa-al, Jud&#8217;s as rich as cream naow; but the
old doctor took him as a boy out o&#8217; the poorhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you say he talks against grandfather?&#8221;
asked &#8217;Phemie, rather curious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it just like folks?&#8221; pursued the man,
shaking his head. &#8220;Yes, sir! Dr. Polly took
Jud Spink inter his fam&#8217;bly and might have made
suthin&#8217; of him; but Jud ran away with a medicine
show&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s made a rich man of himself, you say?&#8221;
questioned &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as,&#8221; admitted the mail-carrier. &#8220;But
everybody respected the old doctor, an&#8217; nobody
respects Jud Spink&#8211;they respect his money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Las&#8217; night Jud says the old doctor was as
close as a clam with the lockjaw, an&#8217; never let
go of a dollar till the eagle screamed for marcy.
But he done a sight more good than folks knowed
about&#8211;till after he died. An&#8217; d&#8217;ye know the
most important clause in his will, Miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In grandfather&#8217;s will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as. It was the instructions to his execketer
to give a receipted bill to ev&#8217;ry patient of his that
applied for the same, free gratis for nothin&#8217;!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
An&#8217; lemme tell ye,&#8221; added the mail-carrier, preparing
to drive on again, &#8220;there was some folks
on both sides o&#8217; this ridge that was down on the
old doctor&#8217;s books for sums they could never hope
to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he started off &#8217;Phemie called after him,
brightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you for telling me what you
have about grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beginning to get interested in neighborhood
gossip already; are you?&#8221; said her sister, when
&#8217;Phemie joined her, and they walked back up the
lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I am getting interested in everything
folks can tell us about grandfather. In his way,
Lyddy, Dr. Apollo Phelps must have been a great
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I always had an idea he was a little
<i>queer</i>,&#8221; confessed Lyddy. &#8220;His name you know,
and all&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But people really <i>loved</i> him. He helped
them. He gave unostentatiously, and he must
have been a very, very good doctor. I&#8211;I wonder
what Aunt Jane meant by saying that grandfather
used to say there were curative waters on the
farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea,&#8221; replied Lyddy.
&#8220;Sulphur spring, perhaps&#8211;nasty stuff to drink.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
But listen here to what Aunt Jane says about
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s better?&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>The older girl&#8217;s tone was troubled. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
make out that he is,&#8221; she said, slowly, and then
she began to read Aunt Jane&#8217;s disjointed account
of her visit the day before to the hospital:</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I never <i>do</i> like to go to such places, girls;
they smell so of ether, and arniky, and collodion,
and a whole lot of other unpleasant things. I
wonder what makes drugs so nasty to smell of?</p>

<p>&#8220;But, anyhow, I seen your father. John Bray
is a sick man. Maybe he don&#8217;t know it himself,
but the doctors know it, and you girls ought
to know it. I&#8217;m plain-spoken, and there isn&#8217;t
any use in making you believe he is on the
road to recovery when he&#8217;s going just the other
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;This head-doctor here, says he has no chance
at all in the city. Of course, for me, if I was
sick with anything, from housemaid&#8217;s knee to
spinal mengetus, going into the country would
be my complete finish! But the doctors say it&#8217;s
different with your father.</p>

<p>&#8220;And just as soon as John Bray can ride in a
railroad car, I am going to see that he joins you
at Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie, the optimistic. &#8220;Oh,
Lyddy! he&#8217;s bound to get well up here.&#8221; For
this chanced to be a very beautiful spring day
and the girls were more than ever enamored of
the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure,&#8221; said Lyddy, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a grump!&#8221; commanded her sister.
&#8220;He&#8217;s just <i>got</i> to get well up here.&#8221; But Lyddy
wondered afterward if &#8217;Phemie believed what she
said herself!</p>

<p>They finished cleaning thoroughly the two
rooms they were at present occupying and began on
the chambers above. Dust and the hateful spiderwebs
certainly had collected in the years the house
had been unoccupied; but the Bray girls were not
afraid of hard work. Indeed, they enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Toward evening Lucas and his sister appeared,
and the former set to work to repair the old pump
on the porch, while Sairy sat down to &#8220;visit&#8221;
with the girls of Hillcrest Farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be nice havin&#8217; you here, I declare,&#8221;
said Miss Pritchett, who had arranged two
curls on either side of her forehead, which shook
in a very kittenish manner when she laughed and
bridled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess, as maw says, I&#8217;m too much with old
folks. Fust I know they&#8217;ll be puttin&#8217; me away
in the Home for Indignant Old Maids over there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
to Adams&#8211;though why &#8216;indignant&#8217; I can&#8217;t for
the life of me guess, &#8217;nless it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re
indignant over the men&#8217;s passin&#8217; of &#8217;em by!&#8221; and
Miss Pritchett giggled and shook her curls, to
&#8217;Phemie&#8217;s vast amusement.</p>

<p>Indeed, the younger Bray girl confessed to her
sister, after the visitors had gone, that Sairy was
more fun than Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;s far on the way to the
Home for Indigent Spinsters, and doesn&#8217;t know
it,&#8221; chuckled &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;What a freak she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you called Lucas&#8211;at first,&#8221; admonished
Lyddy. &#8220;And they&#8217;re both real kind.
Lucas wouldn&#8217;t take a cent for mending the pump,
and Sairy came especially to invite us to the Temperance
Club meeting, at the schoolhouse Saturday
night, and to go to church in their carriage
with her and her mother on Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I suppose they <i>are</i> kind,&#8221; admitted &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;And they can&#8217;t help being funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; said the wise Lyddy, &#8220;if we <i>do</i> try
to take boarders we&#8217;ll need Lucas&#8217;s help. We&#8217;ll
have to hire him to go back and forth to town
for us, and depend on him for the outside
chores. Why! we&#8217;d be like two marooned sailors
on a desert island, up here on Hillcrest, if it
wasn&#8217;t for Lucas Pritchett!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls spent a few anxious days waiting for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
Aunt Jane&#8217;s answer. And meantime they discussed
the project of taking boarders from all
its various angles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we can&#8217;t get boarders yet awhile,&#8221;
sighed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;It&#8217;s much too early in the
season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is it? Aren&#8217;t <i>we</i> glad to be here at
Hillcrest?&#8221; demanded Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But see what sort of a place we lived in,&#8221;
said her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;And lots of other people live hived up in
the cities just as close, only in better houses.
There isn&#8217;t much difference between apartment-houses
and tenement-houses except the front entrance!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be epigrammatical,&#8221; chuckled &#8217;Phemie,
&#8220;but you couldn&#8217;t make many folks admit
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, there are people who need just
this climate we&#8217;ve got here at this time of year.
It will do them as much good as it will father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d make a regular sanitarium of Hillcrest,&#8221;
cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why not?&#8221; retorted Lyddy. &#8220;I guess
the neighbors wouldn&#8217;t object.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie giggled. &#8220;Advertise to take folks
back to old-fashioned times and old-fashioned
cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleeping on feather beds; cooking in a brick
oven like our great-great-grandmothers used to
do! Open fireplaces. Great!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plain, wholesome food. They won&#8217;t have
to eat out of cans. No extras or luxuries. We
could afford to take them cheap,&#8221; concluded
Lyddy, earnestly. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll get a big garden
planted and feed &#8217;em on vegetables through the
summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lyddy, it <i>sounds</i> good,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;But do you suppose Aunt Jane will consent to
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>They received Aunt Jane&#8217;s letter in reply to
their own, on Saturday.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;You two girls go ahead and do what you
please inside or outside Hillcrest,&#8221; she wrote,
&#8220;only don&#8217;t disturb the old doctor&#8217;s stuff in the
lower rooms of the east ell. As long as you
don&#8217;t burn the house down I don&#8217;t see that you
can do any harm. And if you really think you
can find folks foolish enough to want to live up
there on the ridge, six miles from a lemon, why
go ahead and do it. But I tell you frankly,
girls, I&#8217;d want to be paid for doing it, and paid
high!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the kind, if brusk, old lady went on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
tell them where to find many things packed away
that they would need if they <i>did</i> succeed in getting
boarders, including stores of linen, and
blankets, and the like, as well as some good china
and old silver, buried in one of the great chests
in the attic.</p>

<p>However, nothing Aunt Jane could write could
quench the girls&#8217; enthusiasm. Already Lyddy
and &#8217;Phemie had written an advertisement for the
city papers, and five dollars of Lyddy&#8217;s fast shrinking
capital was to be set aside for putting their
desires before the newspaper-reading public.</p>

<p>They could feel then that their new venture was
really launched.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE SCHOOLHOUSE</span></h2>

<p>It was scarcely dusk on Saturday when Lucas
drove into the side yard at Hillcrest with the
ponies hitched to a double-seated buckboard. Entertainments
begin early in the rural districts.</p>

<p>The ponies had been clipped and looked less like
animated cowhide trunks than they had when the
Bray girls had first seen them and their young
master in Bridleburg.</p>

<p>&#8220;School teacher came along an&#8217; maw made
Sairy go with him in his buggy,&#8221; exclaimed Lucas,
with a broad grin. &#8220;If Sairy don&#8217;t ketch a feller
&#8217;fore long, an&#8217; clamp to him, &#8217;twon&#8217;t be maw&#8217;s
fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas was evidently much impressed by the appearance
of Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie when they locked
the side door and climbed into the buckboard.
Because of their mother&#8217;s recent death the girls
had dressed very quietly; but their black frocks
were now very shabby, it was coming warmer
weather, and the only dresses they owned which
were fit to wear to an evening function of any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
kind were those that they had worn &#8220;for best&#8221;
the year previous.</p>

<p>But the two girls from the city had no idea
they would create such a sensation as they did
when Lucas pulled in the ponies with a flourish
and stopped directly before the door of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>The building was already lighted up and there
was quite an assemblage of young men and boys
about the two front entrances. On the girls&#8217;
porch, too, a number of the feminine members
of the Temperance Club were grouped, and with
them Sairy Pritchett.</p>

<p>Her own arrival with the schoolmaster had
been an effective one and she had waited with the
other girls to welcome the newcomers from Hillcrest
Farm, and introduce them to her more particular
friends.</p>

<p>But the Bray girls looked as though they were
from another sphere. Not that their frocks were
so fanciful in either design or material; but there
was a style about them that made the finery of
the other girls look both cheap and tawdry.</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>them</i> stuck-up things air goin&#8217; to live
&#8217;round here; be they?&#8221; whispered one rosy-cheeked,
buxom farmer&#8217;s daughter to Sairy
Pritchett&#8211;and her whisper carried far. &#8220;Well,
I tell you right now I don&#8217;t like their looks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
See that Joe Badger; will you? He&#8217;s got to help
&#8217;em down out o&#8217; Lucas&#8217;s waggin&#8217;; has he? Well,
I declare!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Hen Jackson, too!&#8221; cried another girl,
shrilly. &#8220;They&#8217;d let airy one of us girls fall out
on our heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Sairy, airily, &#8220;if you can&#8217;t keep
Joe an&#8217; Hen from shinin&#8217; around every new gal
that comes to the club, I guess you ain&#8217;t caught
&#8217;em very fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He, he!&#8221; giggled another. &#8220;Sairy thinks
she&#8217;s hooked the school teacher all right, and that
he won&#8217;t get away from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cat!&#8221; snapped Miss Pritchett, descending
the steps in her most stately manner to meet her
new friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cat yourself!&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;I
guess you&#8217;ll show your claws, Miss, if you have a
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Sairy did not hear all of this; and
surely the Bray girls did not. Sairy Pritchett was
rather proud of counting these city girls as her
particular friends. She welcomed Lydia and
Euphemia warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope Lucas didn&#8217;t try to tip you into the
brook again, Miss Bray,&#8221; Sairy giggled to &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;Oh, yes! Miss Lydia Bray, Mr.
Badger; Mr. Jackson, Miss Bray. And this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
Miss Euphemia, Mr. Badger&#8211;<i>and</i> Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;ll do very well, Joe&#8211;and Hen.
You go &#8217;tend to your own girls; we can git on
without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sairy deliberately led the newcomers into the
schoolhouse by the boys&#8217; entrance, thus ignoring
the girls who had roused her ire. She introduced
Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie right and left to such of the
young fellows as were not too bashful.</p>

<p>Sairy suddenly arrived at the conclusion that to
pilot the sisters from Hillcrest about would be
&#8220;good business.&#8221; The newcomers attracted the
better class of young bachelors at the club meeting
and Sairy&#8211;heretofore something of a &#8220;wall
flower&#8221; on such occasions&#8211;found herself the very
centre of the group.</p>

<p>Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie were naturally a little disturbed
by the prominent position in which they
were placed by Sairy&#8217;s man&oelig;uvring; but, of
course, the sisters had been used to going into
society, and Lyddy&#8217;s experience at college and her
natural sedateness of character enabled her to appear
to advantage. As for the younger girl,
she was so much amused by Sairy, and the others,
that she quite forgot to feel confused.</p>

<p>Indeed, she found that just by looking at most
of these young men, and smiling, she could throw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
them into spasms of self-consciousness. They
were almost as bad as Lucas Pritchett, and Lucas
was getting to be such a good friend now that
&#8217;Phemie couldn&#8217;t really enjoy making him feel unhappy.</p>

<p>She was, indeed, particularly nice to him when
young Pritchett struggled to her side after the
girls were settled in adjoining seats, half-way up
the aisle on the &#8220;girls&#8217; side&#8221; of the schoolroom.</p>

<p>These young girls and fellows had&#8211;most of
them&#8211;attended the district school, or were now
attending it; therefore, they were used to being
divided according to the sexes, and those boys
who actually had not accompanied their girlfriends
to the club meeting, sat by themselves on
the boys&#8217; side, while the girls grouped together
on the other side of the house.</p>

<p>There were a few young married couples present,
and these matrons made their husbands sit
beside them during the exercises; but for a young
man and young girl to sit together was almost a
formal announcement in that community that they
&#8220;had intentions!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was quite unsuspected by Lyddy and
&#8217;Phemie Bray, and the latter had no idea of the
joy that possessed Lucas Pritchett&#8217;s soul when she
allowed him to take the seat beside her.</p>

<p>Her sister sat at her other hand, and Sairy was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
beyond Lyddy. No other young fellow could
get within touch of the city girls, therefore, although
there was doubtless many a swain who
would have been glad to do so.</p>

<p>This club, the fundamental idea of which was
&#8220;temperance,&#8221; had gradually developed into
something much broader. While it still demanded
a pledge from its members regarding
abstinence from alcoholic beverages, including the
bane of the countryside&#8211;hard cider&#8211;its semimonthly
meetings were mainly of a literary and
musical nature.</p>

<p>The reigning school teacher for the current term
was supposed to take the lead in governing the
club and pushing forward the local talent. Mr.
Somers was the name of the young man with
the bald brow and the eyeglasses, who was presiding
over the welfare of Pounder&#8217;s District
School. The Bray girls thought he seemed to be
an intelligent and well-mannered young man, if
a trifle self-conscious.</p>

<p>And he evidently had an element that was difficult
to handle.</p>

<p>Soon after the meeting was called to order it
became plain that a group of boys down in the
corner by the desk were much more noisy than
was necessary.</p>

<p>The huge stove, by which the room was overheated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
was down there, its smoke-pipe crossing,
in a L-shaped figure, the entire room to the chimney
at one side, and it did seem as though none
of those boys could move without kicking their
boots against this stove.</p>

<p>These uncouth noises interfered with the opening
address of the teacher and punctuated the
&#8220;roll call&#8221; by the secretary, who was a small,
almost dwarf-like young man, out of whose mouth
rolled the names of the members in a voice that
fairly shook the casements. Such a thunderous
tone from so puny a source was in itself amazing,
and convulsed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he got a great voice?&#8221; asked Lucas,
in a whisper. &#8220;He sings bass in the church choir
and sometimes, begum! ye can&#8217;t hear nawthin&#8217; but
Elbert Hooker holler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is <i>that</i> his name?&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. Elbert Hooker. &#8216;Yell-bert&#8217; the boys
call him. He kin sure holler like a bull!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that very moment, as the bombastic Elbert
was subsiding and the window panes ceased
from rattling with the reverberations of his voice,
one of the boys in the corner fell more heavily
than before against the stove&#8211;or, it might have
been Elbert Hooker&#8217;s tones had shaken loose the
joints of stovepipe that crossed the schoolroom;
however, there was a yell from those down front,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
the girls scrambled out of the way, the smoke
began to spurt from between the joints, and it
was seen that only the wires fastened to the ceiling
kept the soot-laden lengths of pipe from falling
to the floor.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER</span></h2>

<p>The soot began sifting down in little clouds;
but the sections of pipe had come apart so gently
that no great damage was done immediately. The
girls sitting under the pipe, however, were thrown
into a panic, and fairly climbed over the desks
and seats to get out of the way.</p>

<p>Besides, considerable smoke began to issue from
the stove. One of the young scamps to whose
mischievousness was due this incident, had thrown
into the fire, just as the pipe broke loose, some
woolen garment, or the like, and it now began
to smoulder with a stench and an amount of smoke
that frightened some of the audience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you be skeert none,&#8221; exclaimed Lucas,
to &#8217;Phemie and her sister, and jumping up from
his seat himself. &#8220;&#8217;Taint nothin&#8217; but them Buckley
boys and Ike Hewlett. Little scamps&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t want to get soot all over us,
Lucas!&#8221; cried his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or be choked by smoke,&#8221; coughed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>There was indeed a great hullabaloo for a time;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
but the windows were opened, the teacher rescued
the burning woolen rag from the fire with the
tongs and threw it out of the window, and several
of the bigger fellows swooped down upon the
malicious youngsters and bundled them out of the
schoolhouse in a hurry&#8211;and in no gentle manner&#8211;while
others, including Lucas, stripped off
their coats and set to work to repair the stovepipe.</p>

<p>An hour was lost in repairs and airing the
schoolhouse, and then everybody trooped back.
Meanwhile, the Bray girls had made many acquaintances
among the young folk.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, the teacher, was plainly delighted
to meet Lyddy&#8211;a girl who had actually spent two
years at Littleburg. He was seminary-bred himself,
with an idea of going back to take the divinity
course after he had taught a couple of years.</p>

<p>But it suddenly became apparent to &#8217;Phemie&#8211;who
was observant&#8211;that Sairy looked upon this
interest of the school teacher in Lyddy with &#8220;a
green eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, who allowed the boys and young
men to repair the damage created by his pupils
while he rested from his labors, sat by Lyddy all
the time until the meeting was called to order
once more.</p>

<p>Sairy, who had begun by bridling and looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
askance at the two who talked so easily about
things with which she was not conversant, soon
tossed her head and began to talk with others who
gathered around. And when Mr. Somers went
to the desk to preside again Sairy was not sitting
in the same row with the Bray girls and left them
to their own devices for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Lucas, the faithful, came back to &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
side, however. Some of the other girls were
laughing at Sairy Pritchett and their taunts fed her
ire with fresh fuel.</p>

<p>She talked very loud and laughed very much
between the numbers of the program, and indeed
was not always quiet while the entertainment itself
was in progress. This she did as though to show
the company in general that she neither cared for
the schoolmaster&#8217;s attentions nor that she considered
her friendship with the Bray girls of any
importance.</p>

<p>Of course, the girls with whom she had wrangled
on the schoolhouse steps were delighted with
what they considered Sairy&#8217;s &#8220;let-down.&#8221; If a
girl really came to an evening party with a young
man, he was supposed to &#8220;stick&#8221; and to show
interest in no other girl during the evening.</p>

<p>When the intermission came Mr. Somers deliberately
took a seat again beside Lyddy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; shrilled Sairy. &#8220;Some
folks are as bold as brass. Humph!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, as it happened, both Lyddy and the
school teacher were quite ignorant of the stir they
were creating. The green-eyed monster roared
right in their ears without either of them being
the wiser. Lyddy was only sorry that Sairy
Pritchett proved to be such a loud-talking and
rather unladylike person.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie, who was younger, and observant,
soon saw what was the matter. She wished to
warn Lyddy, but did not know how to do so.
And, of course, she knew her sister and the
school teacher were talking of quite impersonal
things.</p>

<p>These girls expected everybody to be of their
own calibre. &#8217;Phemie had seen the same class of
girls in her experience in the millinery shop. But
it was quite impossible for Lyddy to understand
such people, her experience with young girls at
school and college not having prepared her for
the outlook on life which these country girls
had.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie turned to Lucas&#8211;who stuck to her like
a limpet to a rock&#8211;for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucas,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have been very kind
to bring us here; but I want to ask you to take
us home early; will you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&#8211;ye ain&#8217;t sick; be you?&#8221;
demanded the anxious young farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But your sister is,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie, unable
to treat the matter with entire seriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sairy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with <i>her</i>?&#8221; grunted Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you <i>see</i>?&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie, in an
undertone.</p>

<p>&#8220;By cracky!&#8221; laughed Lucas. &#8220;Ye mean
because teacher&#8217;s forgot she&#8217;s on airth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; snapped &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;You know Lyddy
doesn&#8217;t care anything about that Mr. Somers.
But she has to be polite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take us home ahead of them all?&#8221;
demanded the girl. &#8220;Then your sister can have
the schoolmaster.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By cracky! is that it?&#8221; queried Lucas.
&#8220;Why&#8211;if you say so. I&#8217;ll do just like you want
me to, Miss &#8217;Phemie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good boy, Lucas&#8211;and I hope you
won&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;We like you,
but we have been brought up to have boy friends
who don&#8217;t play at being grown up,&#8221; added &#8217;Phemie,
as earnestly as she had ever spoken in her
life. &#8220;We like to have <i>friends</i>, not <i>beaux</i>.
Won&#8217;t you be our friend, Lucas?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>She said this so low that nobody else could
hear it but young Pritchett; but so emphatically
that the tears came to her eyes. Lucas gaped
at her for a moment; then he seemed to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I get yer, &#8217;Phemie,&#8221; he declared, with emphasis,
&#8220;an&#8217; you kin bank on me. Sairy&#8217;s foolish&#8211;maw&#8217;s
made her so, I s&#8217;pose. But I ain&#8217;t as
big a fool as I look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like a fool, Lucas,&#8221; said
&#8217;Phemie, faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been brought up different from us
folks,&#8221; pursued the young farmer. &#8220;And I can
see that we look mighty silly to you gals from the
city. But I&#8217;ll play fair. You let me be your
friend, &#8217;Phemie.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girl had to wink hard to keep back
the tears. There was &#8220;good stuff&#8221; in this young
farmer, and she was sorry she had ever&#8211;even in
secret&#8211;made fun of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucas, you are a good boy,&#8221; she repeated,
&#8220;and we both like you. You&#8217;ll get us away from
here and let Sairy have her chance at the schoolmaster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Though I don&#8217;t care
about Sairy. She&#8217;s old enough to know better,&#8221;
he added, with the usual brother&#8217;s callousness regarding
his sister.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>&#8220;She feels neglected and will naturally be mad
at Lyddy,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie said. &#8220;But if we slip out
during some recitation or song, it won&#8217;t be noticed
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Lucas. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go out ahead
and unhitch the ponies and get their blankets off.
You gals can come along in about five minutes.
Now! Mayme Lowry is going to read the &#8216;Club
Chronicles&#8217;&#8211;that&#8217;s a sort of history of neighborhood
doin&#8217;s since the last meetin&#8217;. She hits on
most ev&#8217;rybody, and they will all wanter hear.
We&#8217;ll git aout quiet like.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, when Miss Lowry arose to read her manuscript,
Lucas left his seat and &#8217;Phemie whispered
to Lyddy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your coat, dear. I want to go home.
Lucas has gone out to get the team.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;what&#8217;s the matter, child?&#8221; demanded
the older sister, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Only I want to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-ell&#8211;if you must&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything more, but come on,&#8221; commanded
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>They arose together and tiptoed out. If Sairy
saw them she made no sign, nor did anybody bar
their escape.</p>

<p>Lucas had got his team into the road. &#8220;Here
ye be!&#8221; he said, cheerfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8220;But&#8211;but how about Sairy?&#8221; cried the puzzled
Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;ll ride home with the school teacher,&#8221;
declared Lucas, chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I really am surprised at you, &#8217;Phemie,&#8221;
said the older sister. &#8220;It seems rather discourteous
to leave before the entertainment was
over&#8211;unless you are ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; said the younger girl, demurely.
&#8220;But I got <i>so</i> nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; whispered Lyddy. &#8220;Some of those
awful recitations <i>were</i> trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>And &#8217;Phemie had to giggle at that; but she
made no further explanation.</p>

<p>The ponies drew them swiftly over the mountain
road and under the white light of a misty
moon they quickly turned into the lane
leading to Hillcrest. As the team dropped to a
walk, &#8217;Phemie suddenly leaned forward and
clutched the driver&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look yonder, Lucas!&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;There, by the corner of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; muttered Lucas, and brought the
horses to a halt.</p>

<p>The girls and Lucas all saw the two figures.
They wavered for a moment and then one hurried
behind the high stone wall between the yard and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
the old orchard. The other crossed the front
yard boldly toward the highroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;They came from the direction of the east
wing,&#8221; whispered &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose they are?&#8221; asked Lyddy,
more placidly. &#8220;Somebody who tried to call on
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there feller,&#8221; said Lucas, slowly, his
voice shaking oddly, as he pointed with his whip
after the man who just then gained the highroad,
&#8220;that there feller is Lem Judson Spink&#8211;I know
his long hair and broad-brimmed hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;The man who
lived here at Hillcrest when he was a boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they say,&#8221; admitted Lucas. &#8220;Dad knew
him. They went to school together. He&#8217;s a
rich man now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what could he possibly want up here?&#8221;
queried Lyddy, as the ponies went on. &#8220;And
who was the other man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I dunno who he was,&#8221; blurted out Lucas,
still much disturbed in voice and appearance.</p>

<p>But after the girls had disembarked, and bidden
Lucas good night, and the young farmer had
driven away, &#8217;Phemie said to her sister, as the
latter was unlocking the door of the farmhouse:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know who that other man was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other man?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;The one who ran behind the stone wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, who was it, &#8217;Phemie?&#8221; queried her
sister, with revived interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cyrus Pritchett,&#8221; stated &#8217;Phemie, with conviction,
and nothing her sister could say would
shake her belief in that fact.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>LYDDY DOESN&#8217;T WANT IT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Who is this Mr. Spink?&#8221; asked Lydia Bray
the following morning, as they prepared for
church.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful spring morning. There
had been a pattering shower at sunrise and the
eaves were still dripping, while every blade of the
freshly springing grass in the side yard&#8211;which
was directly beneath the girls&#8217; window&#8211;sparkled
as though diamond-decked over night.</p>

<p>The old trees in the orchard were pushing both
leaf and blossom&#8211;especially the plum and peach
trees. In the distance other orchards were blowing,
too, and that spattered the mountainside with
patches of what looked to be pale pink mist.</p>

<p>The faint tinkling of the sheep-bells came
across the hills to the ears of Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie.
The girls were continually going to the window
or door to watch the vast panorama of the mountainside
and valley, spread below them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who <i>is</i> this Mr. Spink?&#8221; repeated Lyddy.</p>

<p>Her sister explained what she knew of the man
who&#8211;once a poorhouse boy&#8211;was now counted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
a rich man and the proprietor of Diamond Grits,
the popular breakfast food.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lived here at Hillcrest as a boy, with
grandfather,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s <i>that</i> got to do with his coming up
here now&#8211;and at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And with Mr. Pritchett?&#8221; finished &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I am going to ask Mr. Pritchett about
it. They surely weren&#8217;t after vinegar so late at
night,&#8221; Lyddy observed.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie did not prolong the discussion.
In her secret thoughts the younger Bray girl believed
that it was Cyrus Pritchett and Mr. Spink
whom she had heard about the old house the
night she and Lyddy had first slept at Hillcrest.</p>

<p>There was no use worrying Lyddy about it,
she told herself.</p>

<p>A little later the roan ponies appeared with
the Pritchett buckboard. Instead of Mrs. Pritchett
and her daughter, however, the good lady&#8217;s
companion on the front seat was Lucas, who
drove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me!&#8221; cried Lyddy. &#8220;I hope we
haven&#8217;t turned Miss Pritchett out of her seat.
Surely we three girls could have squeezed in here
on the back seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said Mrs. Pritchett. &#8220;That ain&#8217;t it,
at all. Sairy ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to church this mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s not ill?&#8221; asked Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. She ain&#8217;t got no misery as I can
find out; but she sartainly has a grouch! A bear
with a sore head in fly time would be a smilin&#8217;
work of Grace &#8217;side of Sairy Pritchett ever since
she come home from the Temperance Club las&#8217;
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; came from &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8213;She surely isn&#8217;t angry because we
went home early?&#8221; cried Lyddy. &#8220;My sister,
you see, got nervous&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon &#8217;taint that,&#8221; Lucas hastened to say.
&#8220;More likely she&#8217;s sore on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t nawthin&#8217; of the kind, an&#8217; you know
it, Lucas,&#8221; declared his mother. &#8220;Though ye
might have driven &#8217;round by the schoolhouse ag&#8217;in
and brought her home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I thought she&#8217;d ride back with school
teacher. She went with him,&#8221; returned Lucas,
on the defensive.</p>

<p>&#8220;She walked home,&#8221; said Mrs. Pritchett,
shortly. &#8220;I dunno why. She won&#8217;t tell <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope she isn&#8217;t ill,&#8221; remarked the unconscious
Lyddy.</p>

<p>But Lucas cast a knowing look over his
shoulder at &#8217;Phemie and the latter had hard work
to keep her own countenance straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mrs. Pritchett, more briskly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
&#8220;ye can&#8217;t always sometimes tell what the matter
is with these young gals. They gits crotchets in
their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kept up the fiction that Sairy was a young
and flighty miss; but even &#8217;Phemie could no longer
laugh at her for it. It was the mother&#8217;s pitiful
attempt to aid her daughter&#8217;s chances for that
greatly-to-be-desired condition&#8211;matrimony.</p>

<p>The roads were still muddy; nevertheless the
drive over the ridge to Cornell Chapel was lovely.
For some time the girls had been noting the
procession of carriages and wagons winding over
the mountain roads, all verging upon this main
trail over the ridge which passed so close to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>Lucas, driving the ponies at a good clip, joined
the procession. Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie recognized
several of the young people they had met the
night before at the Temperance Club&#8211;notably
the young men.</p>

<p>Joe Badger flashed by in a red-wheeled buggy
and beside him sat the buxom, red-faced girl who
had voiced her distaste for the city-bred newcomers
right at the start. Badger bowed with a flourish;
but his companion&#8217;s nose was in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never did think that Nettie Meyers had
very good manners,&#8221; announced Mrs. Pritchett.</p>

<p>They overtook the schoolmaster jogging along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
behind his old gray mare. He, likewise, bowed
profoundly to the Bray girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you did not enjoy yourself last
night at the club, Miss Bray,&#8221; he said to Lyddy,
who was on his side of the buckboard, as Lucas
pulled out to pass him. &#8220;You went home so
early. I was looking for you after it was all
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you are mistaken,&#8221; declared Lyddy,
pleasantly. &#8220;I had a very nice time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they drove on Mrs. Pritchett&#8217;s fat face
became a study.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he never even asked arter Sairy!&#8221; she
gasped. &#8220;And he let her come home alone last
night. Humph! he must ha&#8217; been busy huntin&#8217;
for <i>you</i>, Miss Bray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas cast oil on the troubled waters by saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I carried Miss Lyddy and Miss &#8217;Phemie
away from all of &#8217;em. I guess <i>all</i> the Pritchetts
ain&#8217;t so slow, Maw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Wa-al,&#8221; admitted the good lady,
somewhat mollified, &#8220;you <i>hev</i> seemed to &#8217;woke
up lately, Lucas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chapel was built of graystone and its north
wall was entirely covered with ivy. It nestled
in a grove of evergreens, with the tidy fenced
graveyard behind it. The visitors thought it a
very beautiful place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>Everybody was rustling into church when they
arrived, so there were no introductions then. The
pastor was a stooped, gray old man, who had been
the incumbent for many years, and to the Bray
girls his discourse seemed as helpful as any they
had ever heard.</p>

<p>After service the girls of Hillcrest Farm were
introduced to many of the congregation by Mrs.
Pritchett. Naturally these were the middle-aged,
or older, members of the flock&#8211;mostly ladies
who knew, or remembered, the girls&#8217; mother and
Aunt Jane. Indeed, it was rather noticeable that
the young women and girls did not come forward
to meet Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Not that either of the sisters cared. They
liked the matrons who attended Cornell Chapel
much better than they had most of the youthful
members of the Temperance Club.</p>

<p>Some of the young men waited their chance in
the vestibule to get a bow and a smile of recognition
from the newcomers; but only the schoolmaster
dared attach himself for any length of
time to the Pritchett party.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Pritchett could not fail to take note
of this at length. The teacher was deep in some
unimportant discussion with Lyddy, who was
sweetly unconscious that she was fanning the fire
of suspicion in Mrs. Pritchett&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>That lady finally broke in with a loud &#8220;Ahem!&#8221;
following it with: &#8220;I re&#8217;lly don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
happened to my Sairy. She&#8217;s right poorly to-day,
Mr. Somers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I&#8211;I&#8217;m sorry to hear it,&#8221; said the
startled, yet quite unsuspicious teacher. &#8220;She
seemed to be in good health and spirits when we
were on our way to the club meeting last
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Pritchett, simpering and
looking at him sideways. &#8220;She seems to have
changed since then. She ain&#8217;t been herself since
she walked home from the meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has a cold?&#8221; suggested the
teacher, blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sairy is not subject to colds,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Pritchett. &#8220;But she is easily chilled in
other ways&#8211;yes, indeed! I don&#8217;t suppose there
is a more sensitive young girl on the ridge than
my Sairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Somers began to wake up to the fact that
the farmer&#8217;s wife was not shooting idly at him;
there was &#8220;something behind it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry if Miss Sairy is offended, or has
been hurt in any way,&#8221; he said, gravely. &#8220;It
was a pity she had to walk home from the club.
If I had known&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;Wa-al,&#8221; drawled Mrs. Pritchett, &#8220;<i>you</i> took
her there yourself in your buggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; he exclaimed, flushing a little. &#8220;I
had no idea that bound me to the necessity of
taking her home again. Her brother was there
with your carriage. I am sure I do not understand
your meaning, Mrs. Pritchett.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mean anything!&#8221; exclaimed the
lady, but very red in the face now, and her bonnet
shaking. &#8220;Come, gals! we must be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie had begun to feel
rather unhappy by this time. Mrs. Pritchett
swept them up the aisle ahead of her as though
she were shooing a flock of chickens with her
ample skirts.</p>

<p>They went through the vestibule with a rush.
Lucas was ready with the ponies. Mrs. Pritchett
was evidently very angry over her encounter with
the teacher; and she could not fail to hold the
Bray girls somewhat accountable for her daughter&#8217;s
failure to keep the interest of Mr. Somers.</p>

<p>She said but little on the drive homeward.
There had been something said earlier about the
girls going down to the Pritchett farm for dinner;
but the angry lady said nothing more about it,
and Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie were rather glad when
Hillcrest came into view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye better stop in an&#8217; go along down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
house with us,&#8221; said the good-natured Lucas, hesitating
about turning the ponies&#8217; heads in at the
lane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we could not possibly,&#8221; Lyddy replied,
gracefully. &#8220;We are a thousand times obliged
for your making it possible for us to attend church.
You are all so kind, Mrs. Pritchett. But this afternoon
I must plead the wicked intention of writing
letters. I haven&#8217;t written a line to one of my
college friends since I came to Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett merely grunted. Lucas covered
his mother&#8217;s grumpiness by inconsequential chatter
with &#8217;Phemie while he drove in and turned the
ponies so that the girls could get out.</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand thanks!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy, brightly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett&#8217;s bonnet only shook the harder,
and she did not turn to look at the girls. Lucas
cast a very rueful glance in their direction as he
drove hastily away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, half
laughing, half in disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! whatever is the matter, do you suppose?&#8221;
demanded her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can&#8217;t see <i>that</i>&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see she&#8217;s angry over Sairy and the school
teacher&#8211;poor man! But what have we to do
with that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s your fatal attractiveness,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie.
Then she began to laugh. &#8220;You&#8217;re a very
innocent baby, Lyd. Don&#8217;t you see that Maw
Pritchett thought&#8211;or hoped&#8211;that she had Mr.
Somers nicely entangled with Sairy? And he
neglected her for you. Bing! it&#8217;s all off, and
we&#8217;re at outs with the Pritchett family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What awful language!&#8221; sighed Lyddy, unlocking
the door. &#8220;I am sorry you ever went to
work in that millinery shop, &#8217;Phemie. It has
made your mind&#8211;er&#8211;almost common!&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie only laughed.</p>

<p>If the Pritchett females were &#8220;at outs&#8221; with
them, the men of the family did not appear to be.
At least, Cyrus and his son were at Hillcrest
bright and early on Monday morning, with two
teams ready for plowing. Lyddy had a serious
talk with Mr. Pritchett first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as. That&#8217;s good &#8217;tater and truckin&#8217; land
behind the barn. It&#8217;s laid out a good many
years now, for it&#8217;s only an acre, or so, and we
never tilled it for corn. It&#8217;s out o&#8217; the way,
kinder,&#8221; said the elder Pritchett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I want that for a garden,&#8221; Lyddy declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t pay me to work none of this &#8216;off&#8217;
land for garden trucks,&#8221; said Cyrus, shortly.
&#8220;Not &#8217;nless ye want a few rows o&#8217; stuff in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
cornfield jest where I can cultivate with the
hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you plant corn here, you must plant
my garden, too,&#8221; insisted Lyddy, who was quite as
obstinate as the old farmer. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like to have
a big garden, and plenty of potatoes, too. I am
going to keep boarders this summer, and I want to
raise enough to feed them&#8211;or partly feed them,
at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Boarders, eh? A gal like you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not rich enough to sit with idle hands,
and I mean to try and earn something,&#8221; Lyddy
declared. &#8220;And we&#8217;ll want vegetables to carry
us over winter, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucas had been listening with flushed and
anxious face. Now he broke in eagerly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You said I could till a piece for myself this
year, Dad. Lemme do it up here. There&#8217;s a
better chance to sell trucks in Bridleburg than
there has been. I&#8217;ll plow and take care of two
acres up here, if Miss Lyddy says so, for half the
crops, she to supply seed and fertilizer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will&#8211;will it cost much, Lucas?&#8221; asked
Lyddy, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That land&#8217;s rich, but it may be sour. Ain&#8217;t
that so, Dad? It won&#8217;t take so very much phosphate;
will it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cyrus was slower mentally than these eager
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
young folk. He had to think it over and discuss
it from different angles. But finally he gave his
consent to the plan and advised his son and Lyddy
how to manage the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You kin git your fertilizer on time&#8211;six or
nine months&#8211;right here in Bridleburg. That
gives you a chance to raise your crop and market
it before paying for the fertilizer,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to get corn fertilizer, too, in the
same way. But &#8217;most ev&#8217;rybody else on the ridge
does the same. We ain&#8217;t a very fore-handed community,
and that&#8217;s a fac&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>At noon Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie talked over the
garden project more fully with Lucas. They
planned what early seeds should be planted, and
Lucas began plowing that particular piece behind
the barn right after dinner.</p>

<p>Lyddy had very little money to work with,
but she believed in &#8220;nothing ventured, nothing
gained.&#8221; She told Lucas to purchase a bag
of potatoes for planting the next day when he
went to town, and he was to buy a few papers of
early garden seeds, too.</p>

<p>And when Lucas came back with the potatoes
he brought a surprise for the Bray girls. He
drove into the yard with a flourish. &#8217;Phemie
looked out of the window, uttered a scream of
joy and surprise, and rushed out to receive her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
father in her strong young arms as he got down
from the seat.</p>

<p>How feeble and tired he looked! &#8217;Phemie
began to cry; but Lyddy &#8220;braced up&#8221; and declared
he looked a whole lot better already
and that Hillcrest would cure him in just no
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that foolish &#8217;Phemie is only crying for
joy at seeing you so unexpectedly, Father,&#8221; said
Lyddy, scowling frightfully at her sister over
their father&#8217;s bowed head as they helped him into
the house.</p>

<p>Lucas hovered in the background; but he could
not help them. &#8217;Phemie saw, however, that the
young farmer fully appreciated the situation and
was truly sympathetic.</p>

<p>The change in Mr. Bray&#8217;s appearance was a
great shock to both girls. Of course, the doctor
at the hospital had promised Lyddy no great improvement
in the patient until he could be got
up here on the hills, where the air was pure and
healing.</p>

<p>Aunt Jane had come as far as the junction with
him; but he had come on alone to Bridleburg
from there, and the agent at the station had
telephoned uptown to tell Lucas that the invalid
wished to get to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right; I&#8217;m all right!&#8221; he kept repeating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
But the girls almost carried him between
them into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctors said you could do more for me
up here than they could do for me there,&#8221; panted
Mr. Bray, smiling faintly at his daughters, who
hovered about him as he sat before the crackling
wood fire in the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Aunt Jane never told us you were
coming!&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the odds, as long as he&#8217;s here?&#8221; demanded
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I shall soon be my old self again up
here,&#8221; Mr. Bray declared, hopefully. &#8220;Now,
don&#8217;t fuss over me, girls. You&#8217;ve got other
things to do. That young fellow who brought
me up here seems to be your chief cook and bottle-washer,
and he wants to speak to you, I
reckon,&#8221; for Lucas was waiting to learn where he
should put the potatoes and other things.</p>

<p>Mr. Bray knew all about the boarding house
project and approved of it. &#8220;Why, I can soon
help around myself. And I must do something,&#8221;
he told them, that evening, &#8220;or I shall go crazy.
I couldn&#8217;t endure the rest cure.&#8221; But it was complete
rest that he had to endure for several days
after his unexpected arrival.</p>

<p>The girls gave up their room to their father,
and went upstairs to sleep. &#8217;Phemie had to admit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
that even <i>she</i> was glad there was at last somebody
else in the house. Especially a man!</p>

<p>&#8220;But I never have thought to ask Mr. Pritchett
about his being up here with that Spink man
last Saturday night,&#8221; Lyddy said, sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better let it drop,&#8221; advised &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get the whole Pritchett family
down on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense! Of course I shall ask him,&#8221;
declared her sister.</p>

<p>But as it happened something occurred the following
day to quite put this small matter out
of Lyddy&#8217;s mind. The postman brought the first
letter in answer to their advertisement. Lyddy
was about to tear open the envelope when she
halted in amazement. The card printed in the
corner included the number of Trimble Avenue
right next to the big tenement house in which the
Brays had lived before coming here to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that strange?&#8221; she murmured, and read
the card again:</p>

<div class='center'>
<p><i>Commonwealth Chemical Company</i><br />
<i>407 Trimble Avenue</i><br />
<i>Easthampton</i></p>
</div> <!-- centered -->

<p>&#8220;Right from the very next door!&#8221; sparkled
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t that beat all!&#8211;as Lucas says.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>But Lyddy had now opened the letter and read
as follows:</p>

<p class='mb00 mt15'>&#8220;L. Bray, Hillcrest Farm, Bridleburg P. O.</p>
<p class='mt00 ml20'>&#8220;Dear Madam:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have read your advertisement and believe
that you offer exactly what my father and I have
been looking for&#8211;a quiet, home-like boarding
house in the hills, and not too far away for me
to get easily back and forth. If agreeable, we
shall come to Bridleburg Saturday and would be
glad to have you meet the 10:14 train on its arrival.
If both parties are suited we can then
discuss terms.</p>

<p class='tar mb00 mr80'>&#8220;Respectfully,</p>
<p class='tar mt00 mr20 mb15'>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Harris Colesworth.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, Lyd?&#8221; demanded
her sister, in amazement.</p>

<p>But Lyddy Bray did not explain. In her own
mind she was much disturbed. She was confident
that the writer of this note was the &#8220;fresh&#8221;
young fellow who had always been at work in the
chemical laboratory right across the air-shaft from
her kitchen window!</p>

<p>Of course, it was quite by chance&#8211;in all probability&#8211;that
he had answered her advertisement.
Yet Lyddy Bray had an intuition that if she answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
the letter, and the Colesworths came here
to Hillcrest, trouble would ensue.</p>

<p>She had hoped very much to obtain boarders,
and to get even one thus early in the season seemed
too good to be true. Yet, now that she had got
what she wanted, Lyddy was doubtful if she
wanted it after all.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COLESWORTHS</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Bray fell in with the boarder project, as
we have seen, with enthusiasm. Although he
could do nothing as yet, his mind was active
enough and he gaily planned with &#8217;Phemie what
they should do and how they should arrange the
rooms for the horde of visitors who were, they
were sure, already on their way to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though Lyd won&#8217;t show the very first letter
she&#8217;s received in answer to our ad.,&#8221; complained
the younger sister. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with
those folks, Lyddy? Do they actually live right
there near where we did on Trimble Avenue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a loft building next to us,&#8221; said
their father, curiously. &#8220;Who are the people,
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody by the name of Colesworth. The
Commonwealth Chemical Company office. It&#8217;s
about an old man to stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One man only!&#8221; exclaimed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a young man&#8211;the one who writes&#8211;to
come up over Sundays, I suppose,&#8221; acknowledged
Lyddy, doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>&#8220;Goody!&#8221; cried her sister. &#8220;<i>That</i> sounds
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself, &#8217;Phemie!&#8221;
chided Lyddy, with some asperity.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bray only laughed. &#8220;I guess I can
play &#8216;he-chaperon&#8217; for all the young men who
come here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your sister is only making
fun, Lydia.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lyddy was more worried in secret about
the Colesworth proposition than she was ready
to acknowledge. She &#8220;just felt&#8221; that Harris
Colesworth was the young man who had
helped them the evening of the fire in the Trimble
Avenue tenement.</p>

<p>&#8220;He found out our name, of course, and when
he saw my advertisement he knew who it was.
He may even have found out where we were going
when we left for the country. In some way
he could have done so,&#8221; thought Lyddy, putting
the young man&#8217;s character before her mind in the
very worst possible light.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is altogether too persistent. I hope he
is as energetic in a better way&#8211;I hope he attends
to his business as faithfully as he seems to attend
to <i>our</i> affairs,&#8221; continued Lyddy, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose this idea of his father coming
up here into the hills is entirely an excuse for him
to become familiar with&#8211;with <i>us</i>. But it looks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
very much like it. I&#8211;I wonder what kind of a
man old Mr. Colesworth can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy ruminated upon the letter she had received
all that day and refused to answer it right
away. Indeed, as far as she could see, the letter
did not really need an answer. This Harris
Colesworth spoke just as though he expected they
would be only too glad to meet him on Saturday
with a rig.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, if it were anybody else, I suppose I
would be glad to do so,&#8221; Lyddy finally had to
admit. &#8220;I suppose that &#8216;beggars mustn&#8217;t be
choosers&#8217;; and if this Harris Colesworth isn&#8217;t
a perfectly proper young man to have about,
father will very quickly attend to <i>his</i> case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Really, Lyddy Bray thought much more about
the Colesworths than her sister and father thought
she did. After being urged by &#8217;Phemie several
times she finally allowed her sister to reply to
the letter, promising to have a carriage at the
station for the train mentioned in Harris Colesworth&#8217;s
letter.</p>

<p>Of course, this meant hiring Lucas Pritchett
and the buckboard. Lucas was at Hillcrest a
good deal of the time that week. He got the
garden plowed and the early potatoes planted, as
well as some few other seeds which would not be
hurt by the late frosts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>Mr. Bray got around very slowly; at first he
could only walk up and down in the sun, or sit
on the porch, well wrapped up.</p>

<p>Like most men born in the country and forced
to be city dwellers for many years, John Bray
had longed more deeply than he could easily express
for country living. He appreciated the
sights and sounds about him&#8211;the mellow, refreshing
air that blew over the hills&#8211;the sunshine and
the pattering rain which, on these early spring
days, drifted alternately across the fields and
woods.</p>

<p>With the girls he planned for the future.
Some day they would have a cow. There was
pasture on the farm for a dozen. And already
Lyddy was studying poultry catalogs and trying
to figure out a little spare money to purchase some
eggs for hatching.</p>

<p>Of course they had no hens and at this time
of the year the neighbors were likely to want
their own setting hens for incubating purposes.
Lyddy sounded Silas Trent, the mail-carrier,
about this and Mr. Trent had an offer to make.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell ye what it is,&#8221; said the garrulous Silas,
&#8220;the chicken business is a good business&#8211;if ye
kin &#8217;tend to it right. I tried it&#8211;went in deep for
incubator, brooders, and the like; and it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
have been all right if I didn&#8217;t hafter be away
from home so much durin&#8217; the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife&#8217;s got rheumatiz, and she can&#8217;t git
out to &#8217;tend to little chicks, and for a few weeks
they need a sight of attention&#8211;that&#8217;s right.
They&#8217;d oughter be fed every two hours, or so,
and watched pretty close.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I had ter give it up last year, an&#8217; this
year I ain&#8217;t put an egg in my incubator.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I could git &#8217;em growed to scratchin&#8217;
state&#8211;say, when they&#8217;re broiler-size&#8211;I sartainly
would like it. Tell ye what I&#8217;ll do, Miss. I&#8217;ll
let ye have my incubator. It&#8217;s 200-egg size. In
course, ye don&#8217;t hafter fill it first time if ye don&#8217;t
wanter. Put in a hundred eggs and see how ye
come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could I pay you?&#8221; asked Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sell ye the incubator outright, if ye want
to buy. And I&#8217;ll take my pay in chickens when
they&#8217;re broiler-size&#8211;say three months old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want for your incubator?&#8221;
queried Lyddy, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten dollars. It&#8217;s a good one. And I&#8217;ll take
a flock of twenty three-months-old chicks in pay
for it&#8211;fifteen pullets and five cockerels. What
kind of hens do you favor, Miss Bray?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy told him the breed she had thought of
purchasing&#8211;and the strain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>&#8220;Them&#8217;s fine birds,&#8221; declared Mr. Trent.
&#8220;For heavy fowl they are good layers&#8211;and
when ye butcher one of &#8217;em for the table, ye got
suthin&#8217; to eat. Now, you think my offer over.
I&#8217;ll stick to it. And I&#8217;ll set the incubator up and
show ye how to run it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy was very anxious to venture into the
chicken business&#8211;and here was a chance to do it
cheaply. It was the five dollars for a hundred
hatching eggs that made her hesitate.</p>

<p>But Aunt Jane had shown herself to be more
than a little interested in the girls&#8217; venture at
Hillcrest Farm, and when she expressed the keys
of the garret chests and bureaus to Lyddy&#8211;so
that the girl could get at the stores of linen left
from the old doctor&#8217;s day&#8211;she sent, too, twenty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it against emergencies. Pay it back
when you can. And don&#8217;t let&#8217;s have no talk about
it,&#8221; was the old lady&#8217;s characteristic note.</p>

<p>Lyddy was only doubtful as to whether this
desire of hers to raise chickens was really &#8220;an
emergency.&#8221; But finally she decided to venture,
and she wrote off for the eggs, sending the money
by a post-office order, and Lucas brought up Silas
Trent&#8217;s incubator.</p>

<p>Friday night Trent drove up to Hillcrest and
spent the evening with the Brays. He set the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
incubator up in the little washhouse, which opened
directly off the back porch. It was a small, tight
room, with only one window, and was easily
heated by an oil-lamp. The lamp of the incubator
itself would do the trick, Trent said.</p>

<p>He leveled the machine with great care, showed
Lyddy all about the trays, the water, the regulation
of heat, and gave her a lot of advice on
various matters connected with the raising of
chicks with the &#8220;wooden hen.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all vastly interested in the new vocation
and the evening passed pleasantly enough.
Just before Trent went, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, what&#8217;s Jud Spink doing up this
way so much? I seen him again to-day when I
came over the ridge. He was crossin&#8217; the back
of your farm. He didn&#8217;t have no gun; and, at
any rate, there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in season jest now&#8211;&#8217;nless
it&#8217;s crows,&#8221; and the mail-carrier laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spink?&#8221; asked Mr. Bray, who had not yet
gone to bed. &#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lemuel Judson Spink,&#8221; explained &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a man who used to live here with grandfather
when he was a boy&#8211;when <i>Spink</i> was a
boy; not grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a rich man now,&#8221; said Lyddy. &#8220;He
owns a breakfast food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Diamond Grits,&#8221; added &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s rich enough,&#8221; grunted Trent. &#8220;Rich
enough so&#8217;t he can loaf around Bridleburg for
months at a time. Been here now for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, could that be the Spink your Aunt Jane
told me once made her an offer for the farm?&#8221;
asked Mr. Bray, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Hillcrest?&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Oh, I hope
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, child, if she could sell the place it would
be a good thing for Jane. She has none too much
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t she sell to him?&#8221; asked
Lyddy, quite as anxious as her sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t offer her much, if anything, for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that like Jud?&#8221; cackled Trent. &#8220;He
is allus grouching about the old doctor for being
as tight as the bark to a tree; but when it comes
to a bargain, Jud Spink will wring yer nose
ev&#8217;ry time&#8211;if he can. Glad Mis&#8217; Hammon&#8217; didn&#8217;t
sell to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he didn&#8217;t want Hillcrest very much,&#8221;
said Mr. Bray, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t want nothin&#8217; &#8217;nless it&#8217;s cheap,&#8221; declared
Trent. &#8220;He&#8217;s picked up some mortgage
notes, and the like, on property he thinks he can
foreclose on. Got a jedgment against the Widder
Harrison&#8217;s little place over the ridge, I understand.
But Jud Spink wouldn&#8217;t pay more&#8217;n ha&#8217;f
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
price for a gold eagle. He&#8217;d claim &#8217;twas second-hand,
if it warn&#8217;t fresh from the mint,&#8221; and the
mail-carrier went off, chuckling over his own joke.</p>

<p>Both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie forgot, however,
about the curious actions of Mr. Spink, or his
desire to buy Hillcrest, in their interest in the
coming of the only people who had, thus far, answered
their advertisement for boarders.</p>

<p>Lucas met the 10:14 train on Saturday morning,
and before noon he drove into the side yard
with an old gentleman and a young man on the
rear seat of the buckboard.</p>

<p>Before this the two girls, working hard, had
swept and garnished the whole lower floor of the
big farmhouse, save the east wing, which was
locked. Indeed, Lyddy had never ventured into
the old doctor&#8217;s suite of offices, for she couldn&#8217;t
find the key.</p>

<p>A fire had been laid and was burning cheerfully
in the dining-room&#8211;that apartment being just
across the square side entrance hall from the
kitchen. Lyddy was busy over the cooking arrangements
when the visitors arrived, and &#8217;Phemie
was giving the finishing touches to the table
in the dining-room.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bray, leaning on his cane, met the
Colesworths as they alighted from the buckboard.
Lucas drove away at once, promising to return
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
again with the team in time to catch the four-fifty
train back to town.</p>

<p>Lyddy found time to peep out of the kitchen
window. Yes! there was that very bold young
man who had troubled her so much&#8211;at times&#8211;while
they lived in Trimble Avenue.</p>

<p>He met Mr. Bray with a warm handshake, and
he helped his father up the wide stone steps with
a delicacy that would have pleased Lyddy in anybody
else.</p>

<p>But she had made up her mind that Harris
Colesworth was going to be a very objectionable
person to have about, and so she would not accept
his friendly attitude or thoughtfulness as
real virtues. He might attract the rest of the
family&#8211;already &#8217;Phemie was standing in the door,
smiling and with her hand held out; but Lyddy
Bray proposed to watch this young man very
closely!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANOTHER BOARDER</span></h2>

<p>Lyddy heard her sister and Harris Colesworth
in the hall, and then in the dining-room. The
girls had not made a fire in any other room in the
house. It took too much wood, and the dining-room
was large enough to be used as a sitting-room
&#8220;for company,&#8221; too.</p>

<p>And with the fresh maple branches and arbutus
decorating the space over the mantel, and the
great dish of violets on the table, and the odorous
plum branches everywhere, that dining-room was
certainly an attractive apartment.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned blue-and-white china and
the few pieces of heavy silverware &#8220;dressed&#8221; the
table very nicely. The linen was yellow with
age, but every glass and spoon shone.</p>

<p>The sun streamed warmly in at the windows,
the view from which was lovely. Lyddy heard
the appreciative remarks of the young man as
&#8217;Phemie ushered him in.</p>

<p>But she ran out to greet the old gentleman.
The elder Colesworth was sixty or more&#8211;a frail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
scholarly-looking man, with a winning smile. He,
like Mr. Bray, leaned on a cane; but Mr. Bray
was at least fifteen years Mr. Colesworth&#8217;s junior.</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>you</i> are &#8216;L. Bray&#8217;; are you?&#8221; asked the
old gentleman, shaking hands with her. &#8220;You
are the elder daughter and head of the household,
your father tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am older than &#8217;Phemie&#8211;yes,&#8221; admitted
Lyddy, blushing. &#8220;But we have no &#8216;head&#8217; here.
I do my part of the work, and she does hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, please God,&#8221; said Mr. Bray, earnestly,
&#8220;I shall soon be able to do mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Work is the word, then!&#8221; cried the old gentleman.
&#8220;I tell Harris that&#8217;s all that is the matter
with me. I knocked off work too early.
&#8216;Retired,&#8217; they call it. But it doesn&#8217;t pay&#8211;it
doesn&#8217;t pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be plenty for you to do up here,
Mr. Colesworth,&#8221; suggested Lyddy, laughing.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll let you chop your own wood, if you like.
But perhaps picking flowers for the table will be
more to your taste&#8211;at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8211;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; returned the
old gentleman. &#8220;I was brought up on a farm.
I used to know how to swing an axe. And I can
remember yet how I hated a buck-saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into the house; but Lyddy slipped
back to the kitchen and allowed her father to follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
Harris Colesworth and &#8217;Phemie, with the old
gentleman, into the dining-room.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie soon came out to help, leaving their
father to entertain the visitors while dinner was
being served. Lyddy had prepared a simple
meal, of which the staple was the New England
standby&#8211;baked beans.</p>

<p>She had been up before light, had built a huge
fire in the brick oven, had heated it to a high temperature,
and had then baked her pies, a huge
pan of gingerbread, her white bread, and potatoes
for dinner. She had steamed her &#8220;brown loaf&#8221;
in a kettle hanging from the crane, and the sealed
beanpot had been all night in the ashes on the
hearth, the right &#8220;finish&#8221; being given in the brick
oven as it gradually cooled off.</p>

<p>The girl had had wonderfully good luck with
her baking. The bread was neither &#8220;all crust&#8221;
nor was it dough in the middle. The pies were
flaky as to crust and the apples which filled them
were tender.</p>

<p>When Lyddy brought in the beanpot, wrapped
in a blue and white towel to retain the heat, she
met Harris Colesworth for the first time. To
her surprise he did not attempt to appear amazed
to see her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Bray!&#8221; he cried, coming forward to
shake hands with her. &#8220;I have been telling your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
father that we are already acquainted. But I
never <i>did</i> expect to see you again when you sold
out and went away from Trimble Avenue that
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shows how small the world is,&#8221; said Mr.
Bray, smiling. &#8220;We lived right beside the building
in which Mr. Colesworth works, and he saw
our advertisement in the paper&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was sure it was Miss Bray,&#8221; interrupted
young Colesworth, openly acknowledging his uncalled-for
interest (so Lyddy expressed it to herself)
in their affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said this very frank young man, &#8220;I
knew your name was Bray. And I knew you
were going into the country for Mr. Bray&#8217;s health.
I&#8211;I even asked at the hospital about you several
times,&#8221; he added, flushing a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;How very kind!&#8221; murmured Lyddy, but without
looking at him, as &#8217;Phemie brought in some
of the other dishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all; I was interested,&#8221; said the young
man, laughing. &#8220;You always were afraid of getting
acquainted with me when I used to watch
you working about your kitchen. But now, Miss
Bray, if father decides to come out here to board
with you, you&#8217;ll just <i>have</i> to be acquainted with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bray laughed at this, and &#8217;Phemie giggled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
Lyddy&#8217;s face was a study. It did seem impossible
to keep this very presuming young man at a
proper distance.</p>

<p>But they gathered around the table then, and
Lyddy had another reason for blushing. The
visitors praised her cooking highly, and when they
learned of the old-fashioned means by which the
cooking was done, their wonder grew.</p>

<p>And Lyddy deserved some praise, that was sure.
The potatoes came out of their crisp skins as light
as feathers. The thickened pork gravy that went
with them was something Mr. Colesworth the
elder declared he had not tasted since he was a
boy.</p>

<p>And when the beans were ladled from the pot&#8211;brown,
moist, every bean firm in its individual
jacket, but seasoned through and through&#8211;the
Colesworths fairly reveled in them. The fresh
bread and good butter, and the flaky wedges of
apple pie, each flanked by its pilot of cheese, were
likewise enjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can put us up only half comfortably,&#8221;
declared the elder Colesworth, bowing to Lyddy,
&#8220;I can tell you right now, young lady, that we
will stay. Let us see your rooms, we will come
to terms, and then I&#8217;ll take a nap, if you will allow
me. I need it after this heavy dinner. Why,
Harris! I haven&#8217;t eaten so heartily for months.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8220;Never saw you sail into the menu with any
more enjoyment, Dad,&#8221; declared his son, in delight.</p>

<p>But Lyddy made her sister show them over the
house. They were some time in making up their
minds regarding the choice of apartments; but
finally they decided upon one of the large rooms
the girls proposed making over into bed-chambers
on the ground floor. This room was nearest the
east wing, had long windows opening upon the
side porch, and with the two small beds removed
from the half-furnished rooms on the second floor
of the east wing, and brought downstairs, together
with one or two other pieces of furniture, the
Colesworths declared themselves satisfied with the
accommodations.</p>

<p>Young Colesworth would come out on Saturdays
and return Monday mornings. He would
arrange with Lucas to drive him back and forth.
And the old gentleman would come out, bag and
baggage, on the coming Monday to take possession
of the room.</p>

<p>To bind the bargain Harris handed Lyddy fifteen
dollars, and asked for a receipt. Fifteen
dollars a week! Lyddy had scarcely dared ask
for it&#8211;had done so with fear and trembling, in
fact. But the Colesworths seemed to consider it
quite within reason.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Phemie!&#8221; gasped Lyddy, hugging her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
sister tight out in the kitchen. &#8220;Just think of
<i>fifteen dollars</i> coming in every week. Why! we
can all <i>live</i> on that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M&#8211;m; yes,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie, ruminatively.
&#8220;But hasn&#8217;t he a handsome nose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8211;what&#8213; &#8217;Phemie Bray! haven&#8217;t you
anything else in your head but young men&#8217;s
noses?&#8221; cried her sister, in sudden wrath.</p>

<p>But it was a beginning. They had really &#8220;got
into business,&#8221; as their father said that night at
the supper table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only fear that the work will be too much
for us,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;For &#8217;Phemie and me, you mean, Father,&#8221;
said Lyddy, firmly. &#8220;You are not to work.
You&#8217;re to get well. <i>That</i> is your business&#8211;and
your only business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls will baby me to death!&#8221; cried Mr.
Bray, wiping his eyes. &#8220;I refuse to be laid on
the shelf. I hope I am not useless&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me! Far from it,&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be lots more help to us when
you are perfectly well and strong again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty you can do without taxing
your strength&#8211;and without keeping you indoors,&#8221;
Lyddy added. &#8220;Just think if we get the chicken
business started. You can do all of that&#8211;after
the biddies are hatched.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>&#8220;I feel so much better already, girls,&#8221; declared
their father, gravely, &#8220;that I am sure I
shall have a giant&#8217;s strength before fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Jane had written them, however, certain
advice which the doctor at the hospital had given
to her regarding Mr. Bray. He was to be discouraged
from performing any heavy tasks of
whatsoever nature, and his diet was to consist
mainly of milk and eggs&#8211;tissue-building fuel for
the system.</p>

<p>He had worked so long in the hat shop that his
lungs were in a weakened state, if not actually affected.
For months they would have to watch
him carefully. And to return to his work in the
city would be suicidal.</p>

<p>Therefore were Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie more than
ever anxious to make the boarders&#8217; project pay.
And with the Colesworths&#8217; fifteen dollars a week
it seemed as though a famous start had been made
in that direction.</p>

<p>By serving simple food, plainly cooked, Lyddy
was confident that she could keep the table for all
five from the board paid by Mr. Colesworth and
his son. If they got other boarders, a goodly share
of <i>their</i> weekly stipends could be added on the
profit side of the ledger.</p>

<p>Lucas helped them for a couple of hours Monday
morning, and the girls managed to put the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
room the newcomers had chosen into readiness
for the old gentleman. Lucas drove to town to
meet Mr. Colesworth. Lucas was beginning to
make something out of the Bray girls&#8217; project,
too, and he grinned broadly as he said to &#8217;Phemie:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be able to put up for a brand new
buggy nex&#8217; fall, Miss &#8217;Phemie&#8211;a better one
than Joe Badger&#8217;s got. What &#8217;twixt this cartin&#8217;
boarders over the roads, and makin&#8217; Miss Lyddy&#8217;s
garden, I&#8217;m going to be well fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the road to be a millionaire; are you,
Lucas?&#8221; suggested &#8217;Phemie, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. Jest got one object in view,&#8221; grinned
Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanter drive you to church in my new
buggy, and make Joe Badger an&#8217; that Nettie
Meyers look like thirty cents. That&#8217;s what <i>I</i>
want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lucas! <i>That</i> isn&#8217;t a very high ambition,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to give me an almighty lot of
satisfaction,&#8221; declared the young farmer. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t go back on me; will yer, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ride with you&#8211;of course,&#8221; replied &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;But I&#8217;d just as lief go in the buckboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now <i>that</i>,&#8221; said the somewhat puzzled Lucas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
&#8220;is another thing that makes you gals diff&#8217;rent
from the gals around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Colesworth came and made himself
at home very quickly. He played cribbage with
Mr. Bray in the evening while the girls did up the
work and sewed; and during the early days of his
stay with them he proved to be a very pleasant
old gentleman, with few crotchets, and no special
demands upon the girls for attention.</p>

<p>He walked a good deal, proved to be something
of a geologist, and pottered about the rocky section
of the farm with a little hammer and bag for
hours together.</p>

<p>As Mr. Bray could walk only a little way, Mr.
Colesworth did most of his rambling about Hillcrest
alone. And he grew fonder and fonder of
the place as the first week advanced.</p>

<p>As far as his entertainment went, he could
have no complaint as to that, for he was getting
all that Lyddy had promised him&#8211;a comfortable
bed, a fire on his hearth when he wanted it, and
the same plain food that the family ate.</p>

<p>The girls of Hillcrest Farm had received no
further answer to their advertisement, but the
news that they were keeping boarders had gone
broadcast over the ridge, of course. Silas Trent
would have spread this bit of news, if nobody
else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>But on Saturday morning, soon after breakfast,
Mr. Somers&#8217;s old gray mare turned up their lane,
and Lyddy put on a clean apron and rolled down
her sleeves to go out and speak to the school
teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very good thing about that lane,&#8221;
&#8217;Phemie remarked, aside. &#8220;It is just long enough
so that, if we see anybody turn in, we can primp
a little before they get to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Bray,&#8221; said the teacher, hopping out
of his buggy and shaking hands, &#8220;you see me
here, a veritable beggar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A beggar?&#8221; queried Lyddy, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have come to beg a favor. And a
very great one, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed and went on to explain&#8211;yet his
explanation at first puzzled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose I slept last night, Miss
Bray?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In your bed,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a joke&#8211;or a puzzle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I had to sleep in the barn. You see,
thus far this term I have boarded with Sam
Larribee. But yesterday his boy came down with
the measles. He had been out of school for several
days&#8211;had been visiting the other side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
ridge. They think he caught it there&#8211;at his
cousin&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued Mr. Somers, &#8220;that
does not help me. When I came home from
school and heard the doctor&#8217;s report, I refused
to enter the house. We don&#8217;t want an epidemic
of measles at Pounder&#8217;s School.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I slept in the barn with Old Molly, here.
And now I must find another boarding place.
They&#8211;er&#8211;tell me, Miss Bray, that you intend
to take boarders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;er&#8211;yes,&#8221; admitted Lyddy, faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Colesworth and his son. They have
just come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you put me&#8211;and Molly&#8211;up for
the rest of the term?&#8221; asked the school teacher,
laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know but I could,&#8221; said Lyddy,
her business sense coming to her aid. &#8220;I&#8211;why,
yes! I am quite sure about <i>you</i>; but about the
horse, I do not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely have a stall to spare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty; but no feed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will bring my own grain; and I&#8217;ll let
her pasture in your orchard. She doesn&#8217;t work
hard and doesn&#8217;t need much forage except what
she can glean at this time of year for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8220;Well, then, perhaps it can be arranged,&#8221; said
Lyddy. &#8220;Will you come in and see what our
accommodations are?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so that is how another boarder came to
Hillcrest Farm. Mr. Somers chose one of the
smaller rooms upstairs, and agreed to pay for his
own entertainment and pasturage for his horse&#8211;six
dollars and a half a week. It was a little
more than he had been paying at Larribee&#8217;s, he
said&#8211;but then, Mr. Somers wanted to come to
Hillcrest.</p>

<p>He drove away to get his trunk out of the
window of his bedroom at the measles-stricken
farmhouse down the hill; he would not risk entering
by the door for the sake of his other pupils.</p>

<p>A little later Lucas drove up from town with
Harris Colesworth and his bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; whispered the lanky farmer, leaning
from his seat to whisper to &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;I hear
tell you&#8217;ve got school teacher for a boarder, too?
Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; demanded &#8217;Phemie, somewhat
vexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nawthin&#8217;. Only ye oughter seen Sairy&#8217;s
face when maw told her!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BALL KEEPS ROLLING</span></h2>

<p>The school teacher pressingly invited the Bray
girls to accompany him to the temperance meeting
that evening; his buggy would hold the three,
he declared. But both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie had
good reason for being excused. There was now
work for them&#8211;and plenty of it.</p>

<p>They had to disappoint Lucas in this matter,
too; but Harris Colesworth laughingly accepted
the teacher&#8217;s later proposal that <i>he</i> attend, and
the two young men drove off together, leaving
the girls in the kitchen and old Mr. Colesworth
and Mr. Bray playing cribbage in the dining-room.</p>

<p>It was while &#8217;Phemie was clearing the supper
table that her attention was caught by something
that Mr. Colesworth said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is your neighbor that I see so much
up yonder among the rocks, at the back of this
farm, Mr. Bray?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pritchett?&#8221; suggested Mr. Bray.
&#8220;Cyrus Pritchett. The long-legged boy&#8217;s father.
He farms a part of these acres&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>&#8220;No. It is not Cyrus Pritchett I mean. And
he is no farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; said Mr. Bray.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rather peculiar-looking man&#8211;long hair,
black coat, broad-brimmed hat. I have frequently
come upon him during the last few days.
He always walks off as though in haste. I never
have got near enough to speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; responded Mr. Bray, thoughtfully
scanning his hand, and evidently giving little attention
to Mr. Colesworth&#8217;s mystery, &#8220;why, I&#8217;m
sure I don&#8217;t know what would attract anybody
up in that part of the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saving a man interested in breaking open
rocks to see what&#8217;s in them,&#8221; chuckled Mr. Colesworth.
&#8220;But this fellow is no geologist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie, however, decided that she knew who
it was. Silas Trent had mentioned seeing the
man, Spink, up that way; and, on more than one
occasion, &#8217;Phemie was sure the owner of the
Diamond Grits breakfast food had been lurking
about Hillcrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyddy has never asked Cyrus Pritchett about
that evening he and Spink were up here&#8211;two
weeks ago this very night. I almost wish she&#8217;d
do so. This mystery is getting on my nerves!&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet &#8217;Phemie was not at all sure that there
was any mystery about it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>Lyddy, on the strength of getting her first
boarders, renewed her advertisement in the Easthampton
papers. At once she received half a
dozen inquiries. It was yet too early in the season
to expect many people to wish to come to the
country to board; yet Lyddy painstakingly answered
each letter, and in full.</p>

<p>But she really did not see how she would be
able to get on over the summer with the open fire
and the brick oven. It would be dreadfully hot
in that kitchen. And she would have been glad
to use Mrs. Pritchett&#8217;s Dutch oven that Lucas
had told her about.</p>

<p>But since the first Sunday neither Mrs. Pritchett
or Sairy had been near Hillcrest. Now that Mr.
Somers had established himself here, the Bray
girls did not expect to ever be forgiven by
&#8220;Maw&#8221; Pritchett and her daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad people are so foolish,&#8221; said
Lyddy, wearily. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything to
Sairy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she and her mother think you have. By
your wiles you have inveigled Mr. Somers away
from Sairy,&#8221; giggled &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Phemie!&#8221; gasped her sister. &#8220;If you say
such a thing again, I&#8217;ll send Mr. Somers packing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shucks! Can&#8217;t you see the fun of it!?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;There is no fun in it,&#8221; declared the very
proper Lyddy. &#8220;It is only disgraceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to tell that young Mr. Colesworth
about it,&#8221; laughed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;He&#8217;d just be
tickled to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy looked at her haughtily. &#8220;You <i>dare</i>
include me in any gossip of such a character, and
I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? You&#8217;ll what?&#8221; demanded the
younger girl, saucily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall feel very much like spanking you!&#8221;
declared Lyddy. &#8220;And that is just what you
would deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now&#8211;don&#8217;t get mad, Lyd,&#8221; urged
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;You take things altogether too
seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; responded the older girl, going back
to the main subject, &#8220;the problem of how we
are to cook when it comes warm weather is a very,
very serious matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got to have a range&#8211;ought to
have one with a tank, on the end in which to heat
water. I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em advertised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how can we? I&#8217;ve gone into debt now
for more than thirty dollars&#8217; worth of commercial
fertilizer. I don&#8217;t dare get deeper into the mire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; cried the sanguine &#8217;Phemie, &#8220;the crops
will more than pay for <i>that</i> outlay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a born grump, Lyddy Bray!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody has to look ahead,&#8221; sighed Lyddy.
&#8220;The crops may fail. Such things happen. Or
we may get no more boarders. Or father may
get worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> say such things, Lyddy!&#8221; cried her
sister, stamping her foot. &#8220;Especially about
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older girl put her arms about &#8217;Phemie and
the latter began to weep on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us hide our true beliefs from each
other,&#8221; whispered Lyddy, brokenly. &#8220;Father is
<i>not</i> mending&#8211;not as we hoped he would, at least.
And yet the hospital doctor told Aunt Jane that
there was absolutely nothing medicine could do
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know! I know!&#8221; sobbed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it. He is so brave himself.
He talks just as though he was gaining every day;
but his step is so feeble&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has no color,&#8221; groaned Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, anyhow,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie pursued, wiping her
eyes, her flurry of tears quickly over, as was her
nature, &#8220;there is one good thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t lose hope himself. And <i>we</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
mustn&#8217;t lose it, either. Of course things will
come out right&#8211;even the boarders will come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know that,&#8221; said Lyddy, shaking
her head again.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the woman who wrote you a
second time?&#8221; queried &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Mrs. Castle.
I bet <i>she</i> comes next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>And &#8217;Phemie was right in <i>that</i> prophecy. They
had Lucas meet the train for Mrs. Castle on Saturday,
and &#8217;Phemie went with him. There were
supplies to buy for the house and the young girl
made her purchases before train time.</p>

<p>A little old lady in a Paisley shawl and black,
close bonnet, got out of the train. The porter
lifted down an ancient carpet-bag&#8211;something
&#8217;Phemie had never in her life seen before. Even
Lucas was amazed by the little old woman&#8217;s outfit.</p>

<p>&#8220;By cracky!&#8221; he whispered to &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;You reckon <i>that&#8217;s</i> the party? Why, she&#8217;s
dressed more behind the times than my grandmother
useter be. Guess there must be places on
this airth more countrified than Bridleburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie knew that Mrs. Castle&#8217;s letter had
come from an address in Easthampton which the
Brays knew to be in a very good neighborhood.
Nobody but wealthy people lived on that street.
Yet Mrs. Castle&#8211;aside from the valuable but old-fashioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
shawl&#8211;did not look to be worth any
great fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the girl who wrote to me?&#8221; asked
the old lady, briskly, when &#8217;Phemie came forward
to take the carpet-bag.</p>

<p>Mrs. Castle&#8217;s voice was very resonant; she had
sharp blue eyes behind her gold-bowed spectacles;
and she clipped her words and sentences in a
manner that belied her age and appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie, doubtfully. &#8220;It
was my sister who wrote. <i>I</i> am Euphemia Bray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! And what is your sister&#8217;s name?
What does the &#8216;L&#8217; stand for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lydia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; ejaculated this strange old lady.
&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll ride out to the farm with you. Such
good, old-fashioned names promise just what your
sister said: An old-fashioned house and old-time
ways. If &#8216;L!&#8217; had meant &#8216;Lillie,&#8217; or &#8216;Luella,&#8217;
or &#8216;Lilas&#8217;&#8211;and if <i>you</i>, young lady, had been
called &#8216;Marie&#8217;&#8211;I&#8217;d have taken the very next
train back to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie could only stare and nod. In her
secret thoughts she told herself that this queer
old woman was doubtless a harmless lunatic. She
did not know whether it was quite best to have
Lucas drive them to Hillcrest or not.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got a trunk, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; asked the long-legged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
youth, as the old lady hopped youthfully
into the buckboard, and &#8217;Phemie lifted in the
heavy carpet-bag.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. This is no fashionable boarding
house I&#8217;m going to, I s&#8217;pose?&#8221; she added, eyeing
&#8217;Phemie sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; returned the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve got enough with me in this bag,
and on my back, to last me a fortnight. If I
like, I&#8217;ll send for something more, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>She certainly knew her own mind, this old lady.
&#8217;Phemie had first thought her to be near the three-score-and-ten
mark; but every moment she seemed
to get younger. Her face was wrinkled, but they
were fine wrinkles, and her coloring made her
look like a withered russet apple. Out of this
golden-brown countenance the blue eyes sparkled
in a really wonderful way.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; thought &#8217;Phemie, as they
clattered out of town. &#8220;Crazy or not, if she can
pay her board she&#8217;s so much help. Let the ball
keep on rolling. It&#8217;s getting bigger and bigger.
Perhaps we <i>shall</i> have a houseful at Hillcrest,
after all.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RUNAWAY GRANDMOTHER</span></h2>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie was immensely curious about this
strange little old lady who was dressed so oddly,
yet who apparently came from the wealthiest section
of the city of Easthampton. The young girl
could not bring herself to ask questions of their
visitor&#8211;let Lyddy do that, if she thought it necessary.
But, as it chanced, up to a certain point
Mrs. Castle was quite open of speech and free
to communicate information about herself.</p>

<p>As soon as they had got out of town she turned
to &#8217;Phemie and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect you think I&#8217;m as queer as Dick&#8217;s
hat-band, Euphemia? I am quite sure you never
saw a person like me before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;Mrs. Castle&#8211;not <i>just</i> like you,&#8221; admitted
the embarrassed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect not! Well, I presume there are
other old women, who are grandmothers, and
have got all tangled up in these new-fangled notions
that women have&#8211;Laws&#8217; sake! I might
as well tell you right off that I&#8217;ve run away!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>&#8220;Run away?&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, with a vision of
keepers from an asylum coming to Hillcrest to
take away their new boarder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I have done! None of
my folks know where I have gone. I just wrote
a note, telling them not to look for me, and that
I was going back to old-fashioned times, if I could
find &#8217;em. Then I got this bag out of the cupboard&#8211;I&#8217;d
kept it all these years&#8211;packed it with my
very oldest duds, and&#8211;well, here I am!&#8221; and
the old lady&#8217;s laugh rang out as shrill and clear
as a blackbird&#8217;s call.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have astonished you; have I?&#8221; she pursued.
&#8220;And I suppose I have astonished my folks. But
they know I&#8217;m perfectly capable of taking care of
myself. I ought to be. Why, I&#8217;m a grandmother
three times!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Three times?&#8217;&#8221; repeated the amazed
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Euphemia Bray. Three grandchildren&#8211;two
girls and a boy. And they are
always telling folks how up-to-date grandma is!
I&#8217;m sick of being up-to-date. I&#8217;m sick of dressing
so that folks behind me on the street can&#8217;t tell
whether I&#8217;m a grandmother or my own youngest
grandchild!</p>

<p>&#8220;We just live in a perfect whirl of excitement.
&#8216;Pleasure,&#8217; they call it. But it&#8217;s gotten to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
nuisance. My daughter-in-law has her head full
of society matters and club work. The girls and
Tom spend all but the little time they are obliged
to give to books in the private schools they attend,
in dancing and theatre parties, and the like.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here a week ago I found my son&#8211;their
father&#8211;a man forty-five years old, and bald, and
getting fat, being taught the tango by a French
dancing professor in the back drawing-room!&#8221;
exclaimed Mrs. Castle, in a tone of disgust that
almost convulsed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was enough. That was the last straw
on the camel&#8217;s back. I made up my mind when
I read your sister&#8217;s advertisement that I would
like to live simply and with simple people again.
I&#8217;d like really to <i>feel</i> like a grandmother, and
<i>dress</i> like one, and <i>be</i> one.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I like it up here at your place I shall
stay through the summer. No hunting-lodge in
the Adirondacks for me this spring, or Newport,
or the Pier later, or anything of that kind. I&#8217;m
going to sit on your porch and knit socks. My
mother did when <i>she</i> was a grandmother. This
is her shawl, and mother and father took this old
carpet-bag with them when they went on their
honeymoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother enjoyed her old age. She spent it
quietly, and it was <i>lovely</i>,&#8221; declared Mrs. Castle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
with a note in her voice that made &#8217;Phemie sober
at once. &#8220;I am going to have quiet, and repose,
and a simple life, too, before I have to die.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just killing me keeping up with the times.
I don&#8217;t want to keep up with &#8217;em. I want them
to drift by me, and leave me stranded in some
pleasant, sunny place, where I only have to look
on. And that&#8217;s what I am going to get at Hillcrest&#8211;just
that kind of a place&#8211;if you&#8217;ve got it
to sell,&#8221; completed this strange old lady, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie Bray scarcely knew what to say. She
was not sure that Mrs. Castle was quite right in
her mind; yet what she said, though so surprising,
sounded like sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to Lyddy; she&#8217;ll know what to say
and do,&#8221; thought the younger sister, with faith
in the ability of Lyddy to handle any emergency.</p>

<p>And Lyddy handled the old lady as simply as
she did everything. She refused to see anything
particularly odd in Mrs. Castle&#8217;s dress, manner,
or outlook on life.</p>

<p>The old lady chose one of the larger rooms on
the second floor, considered the terms moderate,
and approved of everything she saw about the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make no excuses for giving me a feather bed
to sleep on. I believe it will add half a dozen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
years to my life,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Feather beds!
My! I never expected to see such a joy again&#8211;let
alone experience it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our circle is broadening,&#8221; said old Mr. Colesworth,
at supper that evening. &#8220;Come! I
have a three-handed counter for cribbage. Shall
we take Mrs. Castle into our game, Mr. Bray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she will so honor us,&#8221; agreed the girls&#8217;
father, bowing to the little old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! that&#8217;s hearty of you,&#8221; said the brisk
Mrs. Castle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll postpone beginning knitting
my son a pair of socks that he&#8217;d never wear, until
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>For she had actually brought along with her
knitting needles and a hank of grey yarn. It
grew into a nightly occurrence, this three-handed
cribbage game. When Mr. Somers had no
lessons to &#8220;get up,&#8221; or no examination papers
to mark, he spent the evening with Lyddy and
&#8217;Phemie. He even helped with the dish-wiping
and helped to bring in the wood for the morning
fires.</p>

<p>Fire was laid in the three chambers, as well
as the dining-room, to light on cold mornings, or
on damp days; Lucas had spent a couple more
days in chopping wood. But as the season advanced
there was less and less need of these in
the sleeping rooms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>There were, of course, wet and gloomy days,
when the old folks were glad to sit over the
dining-room fire, the elements forbidding outdoors
to them. But they kept cheerful. And not a
little of this cheerfulness was spread by Lyddy
and &#8217;Phemie. The older girl&#8217;s thoughtfulness
for others made her much beloved, while &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
high spirits were contagious.</p>

<p>On Saturday, when Harris Colesworth arrived
from town to remain over Sunday, Hillcrest was
indeed a lively place. This very self-possessed
young man took a pleasant interest in everything
that went on about the house and farm. Lyddy
was still inclined to snub him&#8211;only, he wouldn&#8217;t
be snubbed. He did not force his attentions upon
her; but while he was at Hillcrest it seemed to
Lyddy as though he was right at her elbow all
the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;He pervades the whole place,&#8221; she complained
to &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Why&#8211;he&#8217;s under foot,
like a kitten!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; exclaimed the younger sister. &#8220;He&#8217;s
hanging about you no more than the school
teacher&#8211;and Mr. Somers has the best chance,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Phemie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be a grump! Mr. Colesworth is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
ever so nice. He&#8217;s worth any <i>two</i> of your
Somerses, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>And at that Lyddy became so indignant that she
would not speak to her sister for the rest of the day.
But <i>that</i> did not solve the problem. There was
Harris Colesworth, always doing something for
her, ready to do her bidding at any time, his
words cheerful, his looks smiling, and, as Lyddy
declared in her own mind, &#8220;utterly unable to keep
his place.&#8221;</p>

<p>There never <i>was</i> so bold a young man, she
verily believed!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE QUEER BOARDER</span></h2>

<p>Spring marched on apace those days. The
garden at Hillcrest began to take form, and the
green things sprouted beautifully. Lucas Pritchett
was working very hard, for his father did not
allow him to neglect any of his regular work to
keep the contract the young man had made with
Lyddy Bray.</p>

<p>In another line the prospect for a crop was
anxiously canvassed, too. The eggs Lyddy had
sent for had arrived and, after running the incubator
for a couple of days to make sure that
they understood it, the girls put the hundred eggs
into the trays.</p>

<p>The eggs were guaranteed sixty per cent. fertile
and after eight days they tested them as Trent
had advised. They left eighty-seven eggs in the
incubator after the test.</p>

<p>But the incubator took an enormous amount of
attention&#8211;at least, the girls thought it did.</p>

<p>This was not so bad by day; but they went to
bed tired enough at night, and Lyddy was sure
the lamp should be looked to at midnight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>It was three o&#8217;clock the first night before &#8217;Phemie
awoke with a start, and lay with throbbing
pulse and with some sound ringing in her ears
which she could not explain immediately. But
almost at once she recalled another night&#8211;their
first one at Hillcrest&#8211;when she had gone rambling
about the lower floor of the old house.</p>

<p>But she thought of the incubator and leaped
out of bed. The lamp might have flared up and
cooked all those eggs. Or it might have expired
and left them to freeze out there in the washhouse.</p>

<p>She did not arouse Lyddy, but slipped into her
wrapper and slippers and crept downstairs with
her candle. There <i>had</i> been a sound that aroused
her. She heard somebody moving about the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely father hasn&#8217;t got up&#8211;he promised he
wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; thought &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>She was not afraid of outside marauders now.
Both Mr. Somers and young Mr. Colesworth
were in the house. &#8217;Phemie went boldly into
the kitchen from the hall.</p>

<p>The porch door opened and a wavering light
appeared&#8211;another candle. There was Harris
Colesworth, in <i>his</i> robe and slippers, coming from
the direction of the washhouse.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie shrank back and hid by the foot of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
the stairs. But she was not quick enough in
putting her light out&#8211;or else he heard her
giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halt! who goes there?&#8221; demanded Colesworth,
in a sepulchral voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;A&#8211;a fr-r-riend,&#8221; chattered &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance, friend, and give the countersign,&#8221;
commanded the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chickens!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have had fried eggs, maybe, for all
your interest in the incubator,&#8221; said Harris, with
a chuckle. &#8220;So &#8216;Chickens&#8217; is no longer the
password.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they didn&#8217;t get too hot?&#8221; pleaded the
girl, in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. This is the second time I&#8217;ve been out.
To tell you the truth,&#8221; said Harris, laughing,
&#8220;I think the incubator is all right and will work
like a charm; but I understand they&#8217;re a good
deal like ships&#8211;likely to develop some crotchet
at almost any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s good of you to take the trouble to
look at it for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it is!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But that&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m on earth for&#8211;to do good&#8211;didn&#8217;t you know
that, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221;</p>

<p>She told her sister about Harris Colesworth&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
kindness in the morning. But Lyddy took it the
other way about.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare! he can&#8217;t keep his fingers out of
our pie at any stage of the game; can he?&#8221; she
snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Lyd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;don&#8217;t talk to me!&#8221; returned her older
sister, who seemed to be rather snappish this
morning. &#8220;That young man is getting on my
nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Sunday and the Colesworths had engaged
a two-seated carriage in town to take Mrs.
Castle and Mr. Bray with them to church. There
was a seat beside Mr. Somers, behind Old Molly,
for one of the girls. The teacher plainly wanted
to take Lyddy, but that young lady had not recovered
from her ill-temper of the early morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lyd got out of bed on the wrong side this
morning,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie. However, she went
with Mr. Somers in her sister&#8217;s stead.</p>

<p>And Lyddy Bray was glad to be left alone.
No one could honestly call Hillcrest Farm a lonesome
place these days!</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I wouldn&#8217;t be glad to be
alone here again, with just &#8217;Phemie and father,&#8221;
the young girl told herself. &#8220;There is one drawback
to keeping a boarding house&#8211;one has no
privacy. In trying to make it homelike for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
boarders, we lose all our own home life. Ah,
dear, well! at least we are earning our support.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Lyddy Bray kept her books carefully, and
she had been engaged in this new business long
enough to enable her to strike a balance. From
her present boarders she was receiving thirty-one
and a half dollars weekly. At least ten of it
represented her profit.</p>

<p>But the two young girls were working very
hard. The cooking was becoming a greater burden
because of the makeshifts necessary at the
open fire. And the washing of bed and table
linen was a task that was becoming too heavy for
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we had a couple of other good paying
boarders,&#8221; mused Lyddy, as she sat resting on
the side porch, &#8220;we might afford to take somebody
into the kitchen to help us. It would have
to be somebody who would work cheap, of course;
we could pay no fancy wages. But we need help.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she thus ruminated she was startled by seeing
a figure cross the field from behind the barn.
It was not Cyrus Pritchett, although the farmer
spent most of his Sabbaths wandering about the
fields examining the crops. Corn had not yet
been planted, anyway&#8211;not here on the Hillcrest
Farm.</p>

<p>But this was a man fully as large as Cyrus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
Pritchett. As he drew nearer, Lyddy thought
that he was a man she had never seen before.</p>

<p>He wore a broad-brimmed felt hat&#8211;of the
kind affected by Western statesmen. His black
hair&#8211;rather oily-looking it was, like an Indian&#8217;s&#8211;flowed
to the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>That coat was a frock, but it was unbuttoned,
displaying a pearl gray vest and trousers of the
same shade. He even wore gray spats over his
shoes and was altogether more elaborately dressed
than any native Lyddy had heretofore seen.</p>

<p>He came across the yard at a swinging stride,
and took off his hat with a flourish. She saw
then that his countenance was deeply tanned, that
he had a large nose, thick, smoothly-shaven lips,
and heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Bray, I have no doubt?&#8221; he began, recovering
from his bow.</p>

<p>Lyddy had risen rather quickly, and only
nodded. She scarcely knew what to make of this
stranger&#8211;and she was alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray sit down again,&#8221; he urged, with a wave
of his hand. &#8220;And allow me to sit here at your
feet. It is a lovely day&#8211;but warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; admitted Lyddy, faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a beautiful view of the valley here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am told below,&#8221; said the man, with a free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
gesture taking in Bridleburg and several square
miles of surrounding country, &#8220;that you take
boarders here at Hillcrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Lyddy again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Your rooms are not yet all engaged,
my dear young lady?&#8221; said the man, who seemed
unable to discuss the simplest subject without using
what later she learned to call &#8220;his platform manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; we haven&#8217;t many guests as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he exclaimed again. Then, after a
moment&#8217;s pursing of his lips, he added: &#8220;This
is not strictly speaking a legal day for making
bargains. But we may <i>talk</i> of an arrangement;
mayn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you, sir,&#8221; said Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! No! I am referring to the possibility
of my taking board with you, Miss Bray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; responded the girl, with sudden interest.
&#8220;Do you think you would be suited with
the accommodations we have to offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear miss!&#8221; he exclaimed, with a
broad smile. &#8220;I am an old campaigner. I have
slept gypsy-fashion under the stars many and
many a night. A straw pallet has often been
my lot. Indeed, I am naturally simple of taste
and habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said all this with an air as though entirely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
different demands might reasonably be expected
of such as he. He evidently had a very good
opinion of himself.</p>

<p>Lyddy did not much care for his appearance;
but he was respectably&#8211;if strikingly&#8211;dressed,
and he was perfectly respectful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will show you what we have,&#8221; said Lyddy,
and rose and accompanied him through the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not let any of the rooms in the east
wing?&#8221; he asked, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. Neither upstairs nor down. We
probably shall not disturb those rooms at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally they talked terms. The stranger
seemed to forget all his scruples about doing
business on Sunday, for he was a hard bargainer.
As a result he obtained from Lyddy quite as good
accommodations as Mrs. Castle had&#8211;and for two
dollars less per week.</p>

<p>Not until they had come downstairs did Lyddy
think to ask him his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;And one not unknown to fame, my dear
young lady,&#8221; he said, drawing out his cardcase.
&#8220;Famous in more than one field of effort, too&#8211;as
you may see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your terms are quite satisfactory, I will have
my trunk brought up in the morning, and I will
do myself the honor to sup with you to-morrow
evening. Good-day, Miss Bray,&#8221; and he lifted

his hat and went away whistling, leaving Lyddy
staring in surprise at the card in her hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! it&#8217;s the Spink man we&#8217;ve heard so much
about&#8211;the boy who was taken out of the poorhouse
by grandfather. I&#8211;I wonder if I have done
right to take him as a boarder?&#8221; murmured
Lyddy at last.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WIDOW HARRISON&#8217;S TROUBLES</span></h2>

<p>Later Lyddy Bray had more than &#8220;two
minds&#8221; about taking Professor Lemuel Judson
Spink to board. And &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s &#8220;You never
took him!&#8221; when she first heard the news on her
return from church, was not the least of the
reasons for Lyddy&#8217;s doubts.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie denied flatly&#8211;the next minute&#8211;that
she had any real and sensible reason for opposing
Mr. Spink&#8217;s coming to Hillcrest to board.
Indeed, she said emphatically that she had never
yet expressed any dislike for the proprietor of
Diamond Grits&#8211;the breakfast of the million.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me! why <i>not</i> take him?&#8221;
she said. &#8220;As long as we don&#8217;t have to eat his
breakfast food, I see no reason for objecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in her secret heart &#8217;Phemie was puzzled by
what &#8220;Jud Spink,&#8221; as he was called by his old
associates, was up to!</p>

<p>She believed Cyrus Pritchett knew; but &#8217;Phemie
stood rather in fear of the stern farmer, as did
his whole household.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>Only Lyddy had faced the bullying old man
and seemed perfectly fearless of him; but &#8217;Phemie
shrank from adding to the burden on Lyddy&#8217;s
mind by explaining to her all the suspicions <i>she</i>
held of this Spink.</p>

<p>The man had tried to purchase Hillcrest of
Aunt Jane for a nominal sum. He had been
lurking about the old house&#8211;especially about the
old doctor&#8217;s offices in the east wing&#8211;more than
once, to &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s actual knowledge.</p>

<p>And Spink was interested in something at the
back of Hillcrest Farm. He had been hunting
among the rocks there until old Mr. Colesworth&#8217;s
presence had driven him away.</p>

<p>What was he after on the old farm where he
had lived for some years as a boy? What was
the secret of the rocks? And had the mystery
finally brought Professor Lemuel Judson Spink to
the house itself as a boarder?</p>

<p>These questions puzzled &#8217;Phemie greatly. But
she wouldn&#8217;t put them before her sister. If Lyddy
was not suspicious, let her remain so.</p>

<p>It was their duty to take all the boarders they
could get. Mr. Spink added his quota to their
profits. &#8217;Phemie was just as eager as Lyddy to
keep father on the farm and out of the shop that
had so nearly proved fatal to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s no use in refusing to swallow the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
breakfast food magnate,&#8221; decided &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll down him, and if we have to make a face
at the bitter dose, all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Spink came the very next evening.
He was a distinct addition to the party at supper.
Indeed, his booming voice, his well rounded
periods, his unctuous manner, his frock coat, and
his entire physical and mental make-up seemed to
dominate the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Colesworth listened to his supposedly
scientific jargon with a quiet smile; the geologist
plainly sized up Professor Spink for the quack
he was. Mr. Bray tried to be a polite listener
to all the big man said.</p>

<p>The girls were utterly silenced by the ever-flowing
voice of the ex-medicine show lecturer;
but Mr. Somers was inclined to argue on a point
or two with Professor Spink. This, however,
only made the man &#8220;boom&#8221; the louder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Castle seemed willing to listen to the
Professor&#8217;s verbosity and agreed with all he said.
She was willing after supper to withdraw from
the usual cribbage game and play &#8220;enthralled
audience&#8221; for the ex-lecturer&#8217;s harangues.</p>

<p>He boomed away at her upon a number of
subjects, while she placidly nodded acquiescence
and made her knitting needles flash&#8211;and he
talked, and talked, and talked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>When the little old lady retired to bed Lyddy
went to her room, as she usually did, to see if she
was comfortable for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid our new guest rather bored you,
Mrs. Castle?&#8221; Lyddy ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Lydia,&#8221; replied the old lady,
promptly, &#8220;his talk is very soothing; and I can
knit with perfect assurance that I shall not miss
count while he is talking&#8211;for I don&#8217;t really listen
to a word he says!&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Spink did not, however, make himself
offensive. He only seemed likely to become
a dreadful bore.</p>

<p>During the day he wandered about the farm&#8211;a
good deal like Mr. Colesworth. Only he did
not carry with him a little hammer and bag.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie wondered if the professor had not
come here to board for the express purpose of
continuing his mysterious search at the back of
the farm without arousing either objection or comment.</p>

<p>He watched Mr. Colesworth, too. There
could be no doubt of that. When the old geologist
started out with his hammer and bag, the
professor trailed him. But the two never went
together.</p>

<p>Mr. Colesworth often brought in curious specimens
of rock; but he said frankly that he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
come across no mineral of value on the farm in
sufficient quantities to promise the owner returns
for mining the ore.</p>

<p>Aunt Jane, too, had said that the rocks back
of Hillcrest had been examined by geologists
time and again. There was no mineral treasure
on the farm. <i>That</i> was surely not the secret of
the rocks&#8211;and it wasn&#8217;t mineral Professor Spink
was after.</p>

<p>But the week passed without &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s having
studied out a single sensible idea about the matter.
Friday was a very hard and busy day for the
girls. It was the big baking day of the week.
They made a fire twice in the big brick oven, and
left two pots of beans in it over night.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s enough in the larder to last over
Sunday, thanks be!&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie, when she
and Lyddy crept to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so. What a lot they do eat!&#8221; said
Lyddy, sleepily.</p>

<p>&#8220;A double baking of bread. A dozen apple
pies; four squash pies; and an extra lemon-meringue
for Sunday dinner. Oh, dear, Lyd!
I wish you&#8217;d let me go and ask Maw Pritchett
for her Dutch oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the older sister, drowsily.
&#8220;We will not risk a refusal. Besides, Mr.
Somers said something about an old lady over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
the ridge&#8211;beyond the chapel&#8211;who is selling out&#8211;or
being sold out&#8211;Mrs. Harrison. Maybe she
has something of the kind that she will sell
cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;that&#8211;old&#8211;brick&#8211;oven&#8211;is&#8211;kill&#8211;ing&#8211;me!&#8221;
yawned &#8217;Phemie, and then was sound
asleep in half a minute.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, the girls hustled
about as rapidly as possible and when Lucas drove
up with young Mr. Colesworth they were ready
to take a drive with the young farmer over the
ridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to see what this Mrs. Harrison has
to sell,&#8221; explained Lyddy to Lucas. &#8220;You see,
we need some things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take ye. But
whether the poor old critter is let to sell anything
private, or not, I dunno. They sold her real
estate last week, and this sale of household goods
is to satisfy the judgment. The farm wasn&#8217;t
much, and it went for a song. Poor old critter!
She is certainly getting the worst end of it, and
after putting up with Bob Harrison&#8217;s crotchets
so many years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was interested in Mrs. Harrison and
wanted to ask Lucas about her; but just as they
started Harris Colesworth darted out of the house
again, having seen his father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;Hold on! don&#8217;t be stingy!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a seat empty beside you, Miss Lyddy.
Can&#8217;t I go, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, how could you refuse a person as bold
as that? Besides, Harris was a &#8220;paying guest&#8221;
and she did not want to offend him! So Lyddy
bowed demurely and young Colesworth hopped
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em go, Lucas!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Now, this
is what <i>I</i> call a mighty nice little family party&#8211;I
don&#8217;t see Somers in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Lucas laughed so he could scarcely
hold the reins. But Lyddy only looked offended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop your silly giggling, Lucas,&#8221; commanded
&#8217;Phemie, fearful that her sister would become
angry and &#8220;speak out in meeting.&#8221; &#8220;I want to
know all about this Mrs. Harrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that where you&#8217;re bound&#8211;to the Widow
Harrison&#8217;s?&#8221; asked Harris. &#8220;I have been told
that our new friend, Professor Spink, has sold
her out&#8211;stock, lock, and barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is <i>that</i> who is making her trouble?&#8221; demanded
&#8217;Phemie, hotly. &#8220;I <i>knew</i> he was a mean
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he was a bad man to go to for money,
I reckon,&#8221; agreed Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob Harrison didn&#8217;t mortgage his place to
Jud Spink,&#8221; explained Lucas. &#8220;No sir! He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
got the money of Reuben Smiles, years ago. And
he and his widder allus paid the intrust prompt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;how did it come into Spink&#8217;s hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I dunno. Guess Spink offered Smiles
a bonus. At any rate, the original mortgage had
long since run out, and was bein&#8217; renewed from
year to year. When it come time for renewal,
Jud Spink showed his hand and foreclosed. They
had a sale, and it didn&#8217;t begin to pay the face
of the mortgage. You see, the place had all
run down. Bob hadn&#8217;t turned a stroke of work
on it for years before he died, and the widder&#8217;d
only made shift to make a garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, there was a clause covering all personal
property&#8211;and the widder had subscribed to it.
So now the sheriff is going to have a vendue an&#8217;
see if he kin satisfy Jud Spink&#8217;s claim in full.
Dunno what <i>will</i> become of Mis&#8217; Harrison,&#8221;
added Lucas, shaking his head. &#8220;She&#8217;s quite
spry, if she is old; but she ain&#8217;t got a soul beholden
to her, an&#8217; I reckon she&#8217;ll be took to the
poor farm.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TEMPERANCE CLUB AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>The boys sat in the buckboard and talked
earnestly while Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie Bray
&#8220;visited&#8221; with the Widow Harrison. She was
a tall, gaunt, sad woman&#8211;quite &#8220;spry,&#8221; as Lucas
had said; but she was evidently troubled about
her future.</p>

<p>Her poor sticks of furniture could not bring
any great sum at the auction, which was slated
for the next Monday. She admitted to the Bray
girls that she expected the money raised would
all have to go to the mortgagee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>did</i> &#8217;spect I&#8217;d be &#8217;lowed to live here in
Bob&#8217;s place till I died,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Bob was
hard to git along with. I paid dear for my
home, I did. And now it&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be took away
from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have no relatives, Mrs. Harrison?
Nobody whose home you would be welcome in?&#8221;
asked Lyddy, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a soul belongin&#8217; to me,&#8221; declared Mrs.
Harrison. &#8220;An&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t ask charity of nobody&#8211;give
me my way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;You think you could work yet?&#8221; ventured
Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, bless ye! I&#8217;ve gone out washin&#8217; an&#8217;
scrubbin&#8217; when I could. But folks on this ridge
ain&#8217;t able to have much help. Still, them I&#8217;ve
worked for will give me a good word. No
<i>young</i> woman can ekal me, I&#8217;m proud to say. I
was brought up to work, I was, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t never
got rusty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy looked at &#8217;Phemie with shining eyes.
At first the younger sister didn&#8217;t comprehend what
Lyddy was driving at. But suddenly a light
flooded her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goody! that&#8217;s just the thing!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie,
clasping her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;What might ye be meanin&#8217;?&#8221; demanded the
puzzled Mrs. Harrison, looking at the girls
alternately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just the person we want, Mrs. Harrison,&#8221;
Lyddy declared, &#8220;and we are just the
persons <i>you</i> want. It is a mutual need, and for
once the two needs have come together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t make out what ye mean, child,&#8221; returned
the old woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you want work and a home. We
need somebody to help us, and we have plenty of
space so that you can have a nice big room to
yourself at Hillcrest, and I <i>know</i> we shall get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
along famously. Do, <i>do</i>, Mrs. Harrison! Let&#8217;s
try it!&#8221;</p>

<p>A blush rose slowly into the old woman&#8217;s face.
Her eyes shone with sudden unshed tears as she
continued to look at Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re saying, child!&#8221;
she finally declared, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear Mrs. Harrison! We need you&#8211;and
perhaps you need us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need ye!&#8221; The stern New England nature
of the woman could not break up easily. Her face
worked as she simply repeated the words, in a
tone that brought a choking feeling into &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
throat: &#8220;<i>Need ye!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>But Lyddy went on to explain details, and bye-and-bye
Mrs. Harrison gained control of her
emotions. Lyddy told her what she felt she could
afford to pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t great pay, I know; but we&#8217;re not
making much money out of the boarders yet; if
we fill the house, you shall have more. And
we will be sure to treat you nicely, Mrs. Harrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, child! don&#8217;t say another word!&#8221; gasped
the old woman. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll come. Why&#8211;you
don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing for me&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we&#8217;re doing for ourselves,&#8221; laughed
Lyddy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re givin&#8217; me a chance to be independent,&#8221;
cried Mrs. Harrison. &#8220;That&#8217;s the greatest thing
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; returned Lyddy, sweetly. &#8220;I
think so. That&#8217;s what we are trying to do ourselves.
So you&#8217;ll come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure as I&#8217;m alive, Miss,&#8221; declared the old
woman. &#8220;Ye need have no fear I won&#8217;t.
I&#8217;ll be over in time to help ye with supper Monday
night. And wait till Tuesday with your washin&#8217;.
I&#8217;m a good washer, if I <i>do</i> say it as shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young folks drove back to Hillcrest much
more gaily than they had come. At least, &#8217;Phemie
and Lucas were very gay on the front seat.
Harris Colesworth said to Lyddy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucas has been giving me the full history of
the Widow Harrison&#8217;s troubles. And her being
sold out of house and home isn&#8217;t the worst she&#8217;s
been through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man she married&#8211;late in life&#8211;was a
Tartar, I tell you! Just as cranky and mean as
he could be. Everybody thought he was an old
soldier. He was away from here all during the
Civil War&#8211;from &#8217;61 to &#8217;65&#8211;and folks supposed
he&#8217;d get a pension, and that his widow would have
<i>something</i> for her trouble of marrying and living
with the old grouch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>&#8220;But it seems he never enlisted at all. He was
just a sutler, or camp follower, or something.
He couldn&#8217;t get a pension. And he let folks think
that he had brought home a lot of money, and had
hidden it; but when he died two years ago Mrs.
Harrison didn&#8217;t find a penny. He&#8217;d just mortgaged
the old place, and they&#8217;d been living on the
money he got that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems too bad she should lose everything,&#8221;
agreed Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to stay over Monday and go to
the vendue,&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;Lucas says she has
a few pieces of furniture that maybe I&#8217;d like to
have&#8211;a chest of drawers, and a desk&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! I saw them,&#8221; responded Lyddy,
&#8220;And she&#8217;s got some kitchen things I&#8217;d like to
have, too. I <i>need</i> her Dutch oven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, Miss Lyddy!&#8221; he exclaimed,
eagerly, yet bashfully, &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to try to
cook over that open fire all this summer? It will
kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> need a stove&#8211;a big range,&#8221; admitted
the young girl. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t see how&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me lend you the money!&#8221; exclaimed
Harris. &#8220;See! I&#8217;ll pay you ahead for father
and me as many weeks as you like&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly shall not accept your offer,
Mr. Colesworth!&#8221; declared Lyddy, immediately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
on guard again with this too friendly young man.
&#8220;Of course, I am obliged to you; but I could not
think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She chilled his ardor on this point so successfully
that Harris scarcely dared suggest that they
four go to the Temperance Club meeting at the
schoolhouse that night. Evidently Lucas and he
had talked it over, and were anxious to have the
girls go. &#8217;Phemie welcomed the suggestion
gladly, too. And feeling that she had too sharply
refused Mr. Colesworth&#8217;s kindly suggestion regarding
the kitchen range, Lyddy graciously
agreed to go.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers, the school teacher, was possibly
somewhat offended because Lyddy had refused to
accompany <i>him</i> to the club meeting; but for once
Lyddy took her own way without so much regard
for the possible &#8220;feelings&#8221; of other people. The
teacher could not comfortably take both her and
&#8217;Phemie in his buggy; and why offend Lucas Pritchett,
who was certainly their loyal friend and
helper?</p>

<p>So when the ponies and buckboard appeared
after supper the two girls were in some little
flutter of preparation. Old Mr. Colesworth and
Grandma Castle (as she loved to have the girls
call her) were on the porch to see the party off.</p>

<p>The girls had worked so very hard these past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
few weeks that they were both eager for a little
fun. Even Lyddy admitted that desire now.
Since their first venture to the schoolhouse and
to the chapel, Lyddy had met very few of the
young people. And &#8217;Phemie had not been about
much.</p>

<p>Since Sairy Pritchett and her mother had put
their social veto on the Bray girls the young people
of the community&#8211;the girls, at least&#8211;acted very
coldly toward Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie. The latter
saw this more clearly than her sister, for she had
occasion to meet some of them both at chapel and
in Bridleburg, where she had gone with Lucas several
times for provisions.</p>

<p>Indeed she had heard from Lucas that quite a
number of the neighbors considered &#8217;Phemie and
her sister &#8220;rather odd,&#8221; to put it mildly. The
Larribees were angry because Mr. Somers, the
school teacher, had left them to board at Hillcrest.
&#8220;Measles,&#8221; they said, &#8220;was only an excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>And there were other taxpayers in the district
who thought Mr. Somers ought to have boarded
with <i>them</i>, if he had to leave Sam Larribee&#8217;s!</p>

<p>And of course, the way that oldest Bray girl
had taken the school teacher right away from
Sairy Pritchett&#8213;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie thought all this was funny. Yet she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
was glad Lyddy had not heard much of it, for
Lyddy&#8217;s idea of fun did not coincide with such
gossip and ill-natured criticisms.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was not, however, surprised by the cold
looks and lack of friendly greeting that met them
when they came to the schoolhouse this evening.
Mr. Somers had got there ahead of them. There
was much whispering when the Bray girls came
in with Harris Colesworth, and &#8217;Phemie overheard
one girl whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess Mr. Somers got throwed down, too.
I see she&#8217;s got a new string to her bow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if Lyddy hears such talk as that she&#8217;ll
be really hurt,&#8221; thought &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;I really wish
we hadn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>

<p>But they were in their seats then, with Harris
beside Lyddy and Lucas beside herself. There
didn&#8217;t seem to be any easy way of getting out of
the place.</p>

<p>Nettie Meyers was there&#8211;Joe Badger&#8217;s
buxom friend. She stared hard at &#8217;Phemie and
her sister, and then tossed her head. But Mr.
Badger came over particularly to speak to the
girls.</p>

<p>Sairy Pritchett was very much in evidence.
She sat with half a dozen other young women
and by their looks and laughter they were evidently
commenting unfavorably upon the Bray
girls&#8217; appearance and character.</p>

<p>Lyddy bowed pleasantly to Mr. Badger and the
other young men who spoke to her; but she gave
her main attention to Harris. But &#8217;Phemie noted
all the sidelong glances, the secret whispering, the
bold and harsh words. She was very sorry they
had come.</p>

<p>Alone, &#8217;Phemie could have given these girls &#8220;as
good as they sent.&#8221; Young as she was, her experience
among common-minded girls like these
had prepared her to hold her own with them.
There had been many unpleasant happenings in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
the millinery shop where she had worked, of
which she had told Lyddy nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers came down from the desk to speak
to the party from Hillcrest before the meeting
opened. But everybody turned around to stare
when he did so, and the teacher grew red to his
very ears and remained but a moment under fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hul-<i>lo</i>!&#8221; exclaimed Harris Colesworth, under
his breath, and &#8217;Phemie knew that he immediately
realized the situation. The whole membership&#8211;at
least, the female portion of it&#8211;was
hostile to the party from Hillcrest.</p>

<p>While the entertainment was proceeding, however,
the Bray girls and their escorts were left
in peace. Sairy Pritchett sat where she could
stare at Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie, and they were conscious
of her antagonistic gaze all the time.</p>

<p>But Lucas was quite undisturbed by his sister&#8217;s
ogling and when there came a break in the
program he leaned over and demanded of her in
a perfectly audible voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Sairy! You keep on starin&#8217; like that
and you&#8217;ll git suthin&#8217; wuss&#8217;n a squint&#8211;you&#8217;ll git
cross-eyed, and it&#8217;ll stay fixed! Anything about
<i>me</i> you don&#8217;t like the look of? Is my necktie
crooked?&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the others laughed&#8211;and at Sairy. It
made the spinster furious.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a perfect fool, Lucas Pritchett!&#8221; she
snapped. &#8220;If you ever <i>did</i> have any brains,
you&#8217;ve addled &#8217;em now over certain folks that I
might mention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go it, old gal!&#8221; said the slangy Lucas.
&#8220;Ev&#8217;ry knock&#8217;s a boost&#8211;don&#8217;t forgit that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded &#8217;Phemie, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! that cat&#8217;s goin&#8217; to do somethin&#8217; mean.
I can see it,&#8221; growled Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is your sister,&#8221; admonished &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I come to know her so well,&#8221; returned
Lucas, calmly. &#8220;If she&#8217;d only been a boy
I&#8217;d licked her aout o&#8217; this afore naow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About <i>what</i>?&#8221; asked the troubled &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just over her &#8217;tarnal meanness. And
maw&#8217;s so foolish, too; <i>she</i> could stop her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we came here to-night, Lucas,&#8221;
&#8217;Phemie whispered.</p>

<p>And at the same moment Lyddy was saying
exactly the same thing to Harris Colesworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; said the young chemist, in return,
&#8220;don&#8217;t give &#8217;em the satisfaction of seeing we&#8217;re
disturbed. They know no better. I can&#8217;t understand
why they should be so nasty to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Lucas&#8217;s sister,&#8221; sighed Lyddy. &#8220;She
thinks she has reason for being offended with me.
But I <i>did</i> hope that feeling had died out by this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>&#8220;You say the word and we&#8217;ll get out of here,
Miss Lydia,&#8221; urged Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! No,&#8221; she whispered, for somebody was
painfully playing a march on the tin-panny old
piano, and Mr. Somers was scowling directly
down upon the Hillcrest party to obtain silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! what&#8217;s the matter with that Somers chap,
too?&#8221; muttered Harris.</p>

<p>But Lyddy feared that the teacher felt he had
cause for offence, and she certainly <i>was</i> uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The recess&#8211;or intermission&#8211;between the two
halves of the literary and musical program, was
announced. This was a time always given to
social intercourse. The company broke up into
groups and chattered and laughed in a friendly&#8211;if
somewhat boisterous&#8211;way.</p>

<p>Newcomers and visitors were made welcome at
this time. Nobody now came near the Bray girls&#8211;not
even Mr. Somers. Whether this was intentional
neglect on his part or not they did not
know, for the teacher seemed busy at the desk
with first one and then another.</p>

<p>Sairy Pritchett and the club historian had their
heads together, and the latter, Mayme Lowry,
was evidently adding several items to her &#8220;Club
Chronicles,&#8221; which amused the two immensely.
And there was a deal of nudging and tittering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
over this among the other girls who gathered
about the arch-plotters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;ve got something besides us to
giggle about,&#8221; Lyddy confided to her sister.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie was not sure that the ill-natured
girls were not hatching up some scheme to offend
the Hillcrest party.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;d like to go home,&#8221; ventured &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw! don&#8217;t let &#8217;em chase you away,&#8221; exclaimed
the young farmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know: &#8216;Sticks and stones may break
my bones, but names will never hurt me!&#8217; But
being called names&#8211;or, even having names <i>looked</i>
at one&#8211;isn&#8217;t pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy heard her and said quickly, her expression
very decided indeed:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going&#8211;yet. Let us stay until the
finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by jove!&#8221; muttered Harris. &#8220;I&#8217;d just
like to see what these Rubes would dare do!&#8221;</p>

<p>But girls are not like boys&#8211;at least, some girls
are not. They won&#8217;t fight fair.</p>

<p>The Hillcrest party need not have expected an
attack in any way that could be openly answered&#8211;no,
indeed. But they did not escape.</p>

<p>Mr. Somers rang his desk bell at last and called
the company to order. After a song from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
school song-book, in which everybody joined, the
&#8220;Club Chronicles&#8221; were announced.</p>

<p>This &#8220;history&#8221;&#8211;being mainly hits on what
had happened in the community since the last
meeting of the Temperance Club&#8211;was very popular.
Mayme Lowry was a more than ordinarily
bright girl, and had a gift for composition. It
was whispered that she wrote the &#8220;Pounder&#8217;s
Brook Items&#8221; for the Bridleburg <i>Weekly Clarion</i>.</p>

<p>Miss Lowry rose and unfolded her manuscript.
It was written in a somewhat irreverent imitation
of the scriptural &#8220;Chronicles;&#8221; but that seemed
to please the young folks here gathered all the
more. She began:</p>

<p>&#8220;And it came to pass in the reign of King
Westerville Somers, who was likewise a seer and
a prophet, and in the fourth month of the second
year of his reign over the Pounder&#8217;s School District,
that a certain youth whose name rhymes with
&#8216;hitch it,&#8217; hitched himself to the apron-strings
of a maid, who was at that time sojourning at
the top of the hill&#8211;and was hitched so tight that
you couldn&#8217;t have pried the two apart with a crowbar!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by cracky!&#8221; gasped the suddenly ruddy-faced
Lucas. &#8220;What a wallop!&#8221;</p>

<p>The paragraph was punctuated with a general
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
titter from the girls all over the room, while some
of the boys hooted at Lucas in vast joy.</p>

<p>Lyddy turned pale; &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s countenance for
once rivalled Lucas&#8217;s own in hue. But Miss
Lowry went on to the next paragraph, which was
quite as severe a slap at somebody else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get mad with <i>me</i>, Miss &#8217;Phemie,&#8221;
begged Lucas, in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t help it, Lucas,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll never come to this place with you again.
Don&#8217;t expect it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The amusing but sometimes merely foolish
paragraphs were reeled off, one after the other.
Sometimes the crowd shouted with laughter; sometimes
there was almost dead silence as Miss Lowry
delivered a particularly hard hit, or one that was
not entirely understood at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it came to pass in those days that certain
damsels of the Pounder&#8217;s Brook Temperance Club
gathered themselves together in one place, and
saith, the one to the other:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not so that the young men of Pounder&#8217;s
Brook are no longer attracted by our girls? They
no longer care to listen to our songs, or when
we play upon the harp or psaltery. They pass us
by with unseeing vision. Verily an Easter bonnet
no longer catcheth the eye of the wayward youth,
and holdeth his attention. Selah.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>&#8220;Therefore spake one damsel to the others
gathered together, and sayeth: &#8216;Surely we are
not wise. The young men of our tribe goeth
after strange gods. Therefore, let us awake, and
go forth, and show the wisdom of serpents and&#8211;each
and every one of us&#8211;start a boarding
house!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The young men, who had begun to look exceedingly
foolish during this harangue, suddenly broke
into a chorus of laughter. Even Lucas and
Harris Colesworth could not hide a grin, and the
school teacher hid his face from the company.</p>

<p>The whole room was a-roar. Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie
suffered under the indignity&#8211;and yet &#8217;Phemie
could scarcely forbear a grin. It was a coarse
joke, but laughter is contagious&#8211;even when the
joke is against oneself.</p>

<p>Miss Lowry gave them no time to recover
from this <i>bon mot</i>. She went on with:</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was said of a certain young man, as
he rode on the way to Bridleburg, that he was
met by another youth, who halted and asked a
question of the traveler. But the traveler was
strangely smitten at that moment, and all he could
do was to <i>bray</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were no more shots at the Hillcrest folk
after that&#8211;at least, if there were, the Bray girls
did not hear them. The &#8220;Chronicles&#8221; came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
an end at last. Somehow the sisters got away
from the hateful place with their escorts.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t ever ask me to go to that schoolhouse
again,&#8221; said Lyddy, who was infrequently
angry and so, when she displayed wrath, was
the more impressive. &#8220;I think, Lucas, the people
around here are the most ill-mannered and brutal
folk who ever lived. They are in the stone age.
They should be living in caves in the hillside and
be wearing skins of wild animals instead of
civilized clothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; replied Lucas, gently. &#8220;I
reckon it looks so to you. But they have all got
used to Mayme Lowry&#8217;s shots&#8211;it&#8217;s give an&#8217; take
with most of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no excuse&#8211;there <i>can</i> be no excuse
for such cruelty,&#8221; reiterated Lyddy. &#8220;And we
never have done a single thing knowingly to hurt
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harris Colesworth was silent, but &#8217;Phemie saw
that his eyes danced. He only said, soothingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a different class from your own,
Miss Lydia. They look on life differently. You
cannot understand them any more than they can
understand you. Forget it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But that was more easily said than done.
Forget it, indeed! Lydia declared when she went
to bed with &#8217;Phemie that she still &#8220;burned all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
over&#8221; at the recollection of the impudence of that
Lowry girl!</p>

<p>Of course, common sense should have come to
the aid of the Bray sisters and aided them to
scorn the matter. &#8220;Overlook it&#8221; was the wise
thing to do. But a tiny thorn in the thumb may
irritate more than a much more serious injury.</p>

<p>Lyddy considered Mr. Somers quite as much
at fault for what had happened at the meeting
as anybody else. He was nominally in charge of
the temperance meeting. On the other hand
&#8217;Phemie decided that she would not be seen so
much in Lucas&#8217;s company&#8211;although Lucas was a
loyal friend.</p>

<p>The morrow was the first Sunday of the month
of May, and its dawn promised as perfect a day as
the month ever produced. Now the girls&#8217; flower
gardens were made, the vines &#8217;Phemie had planted
were growing, the old lawns about the big farmhouse
were a vernal green and the garden displayed
many promising rows of spring vegetables.</p>

<p>The girls were up early and swept the great
porch all the way around the house, and set several
comfortable old chairs out where they would
catch the morning sun for the early risers.</p>

<p>The earliest of the boarders to appear was
Harris Colesworth, wrapped in a long raincoat
and carrying a couple of bath towels over his arm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>&#8220;I found a fine swimming hole up yonder in the
brook where it comes through the back of the
farm,&#8221; he declared to the sisters. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
be pretty cold, I know; but nothing like a beginning.
I hope to get a plunge in that brook every
morning that I am up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he went away cheerfully whistling. A
moment later &#8217;Phemie saw Professor Spink dart
out of the side door and peer after the departing
Harris, around a corner of the house. The professor
did not know that he was observed. He
shook his head, scowled, stamped his foot, and
finally ran in for his hat and followed upon Harris&#8217;s
track.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s suspicious of everybody who goes up
there to the rocks,&#8221; thought &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;What
under the sun is it Spink&#8217;s got up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the day&#8211;it was an hour or more before
their usual Sunday dinner time&#8211;something
else happened which quite chased the professor&#8217;s
odd actions out of &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s mind&#8211;and it gave
the rest of the household plenty to talk about, too.</p>

<p>The procession of carriages going to Cornell
Chapel had passed some time since when another
vehicle was spied far down the road toward Bridleburg.
A faint throbbing in the air soon assured
the watchers on Hillcrest that this was an automobile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>Not many autos climbed this stiff hill to Adams;
there was a longer and better road which did not
touch Bridleburg and the Pounder&#8217;s Brook District
at all. But this big touring car came pluckily
up the hill, and it did not slow down until it
reached the bottom of the Hillcrest lane.</p>

<p>There were several people in the car, and one,
a lithe and active youth, leaped out and ran up
the lane. Plainly he came to ask a question, for
he dashed across the front yard toward where
the family party were sitting on the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say,&#8221; he began, doffing his cap to the
girls, &#8220;can you tell a fellow&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>His gaze had wandered, and now his speech
trailed off into silence and his eyes grew as large
as saucers. He was staring at the placidly-knitting
Mrs. Castle, who sat listening to the Professor&#8217;s
booming voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma! Great&#8211;jumping&#8211;horse&#8211;chestnuts!&#8221;
the youth yelled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Castle dropped her ball of yarn, and it
went rolling down the steps into the grass. She
laid down her knitting, took off the spectacles and
wiped them, and them put them on again the better
to see the amazed youth below her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, at length, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m
caught.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HIDDEN TREASURE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call up the governor&#8211;and mom&#8211;and
Lucy&#8211;and Jinny,&#8221; gasped the young fellow,
who had so suddenly laid claim to being
Mrs. Castle&#8217;s grandson. &#8220;I just want them to
<i>see</i> you, Grandma. Why&#8211;why, <i>where</i> did you
ever get those duds? And for all the world!&#8211;<i>you&#8217;re
knitting!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can call &#8217;em up, Tommy,&#8221; said the old
lady, placidly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the bit in my teeth
now, and I&#8217;m going to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we drive in here?&#8221; asked Master Tom,
quickly, of the girls, whom he instinctively knew
were in charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Lyddy. &#8220;Of course any friends
of Mrs. Castle&#8217;s will be welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom sang out for the chauffeur to turn into the
lane, and in a minute or two the motor party
stopped in the grass-grown driveway within plain
view of the people on the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you look at who&#8217;s here?&#8221; demanded
Master Tom, standing with his legs wide apart
and waving his arms excitedly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>The rather stout, ruddy-faced man reading the
Sunday paper dropped the sheet and gazed across
at the bridling old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mother!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma&#8211;if it isn&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed one young
lady, who was about nineteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Castle!&#8221; gasped the lady who sat
beside Mr. Castle on the rear seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, Grandma!&#8221; shouted the other girl,
who was younger than Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you all know me,&#8221; said Grandmother
Castle, rising and leaving her knitting in her chair,
as she approached the automobile. &#8220;I thought
some of sending for some more clothing to-morrow;
but you can take my order in to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Castle! what <i>is</i> the meaning of this
masquerade?&#8221; demanded her daughter-in-law,
raising a gold-handled lorgnette through which
to stare at the old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Daughter Sarah,&#8221; returned Mrs.
Castle, tartly. &#8220;I consider that from <i>you</i> a compliment.
I expect that a gown, fitted to my age
and position in life, <i>does</i> look like a fancy dress
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221; roared her son, suddenly doubled
up with laughter. &#8220;She&#8217;s got you there, Sadie,
I swear! Mother, you look just as your own

mother used to look. I remember grandma well
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Rufus,&#8221; said the old lady, and
there were tears in her eyes. &#8220;Your grandmother
was a fine woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Deed she was,&#8221; admitted Mr. Castle, who
was getting out of the car heavily. He now came
forward and kissed his mother warmly. &#8220;Well,
if you like this, I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t have
it,&#8221; he added, standing off and looking at her
plain dress, and her cap, and the little shawl over
her shoulders.</p>

<p>The girls and Master Tom had already kissed
her; now Mrs. Castle the younger got down and
pecked at her mother-in-law&#8217;s cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always done everything
to make you feel at home with us, Mother
Castle. I&#8217;ve tried to make you one of the family
right along. And you belong to the same clubs
I do. Surely&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just exactly it!&#8221; cried the little old
lady, shaking her head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong in the
same clubs with you. I don&#8217;t want to belong to
any club&#8211;unless it&#8217;s a grandmothers&#8217; club. And
I want simple living&#8211;and country air&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all these Rubes?&#8221; chuckled Mr. Castle,
waving his hand to take in the surrounding country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>&#8220;Quite so, Rufus. But you would better postpone
your criticisms until&#8213; Ah, let me introduce
my son, Mr. Colesworth,&#8221; she added, as the
old gentleman and Harris appeared from the side
yard. &#8220;And young Mr. Harris Colesworth, of
the Commonwealth Chemical Company. Perhaps
you&#8217;ve heard of the Colesworths, Rufus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless us and save us!&#8221; murmured Mr. Castle.
&#8220;You&#8217;re from Easthampton, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady continued to introduce her family
to the Brays, to Mr. Somers, and even to Professor
Spink. The latter came forward with a
flourish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spink&#8211;Lemuel Judson Spink, M.D., proprietor
of Stonehedge Bitters, and Diamond Grits,
the breakfast of the million,&#8221; the professor explained,
bowing low before Mrs. Rufus Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And these two smart girls I have adopted as
grandchildren, too,&#8221; declared the older Mrs.
Castle, drawing Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie forward.
&#8220;These are the hard-working, cheerful, kind-hearted
girls who make this delightful home at
Hillcrest for us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Castle makes too much of what
we do,&#8221; said Lyddy, softly. &#8220;You see, &#8217;Phemie
and I are only too glad to have a grandmother;
we do not remember ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, God forgive me! I&#8217;d almost forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
what mine was like,&#8221; said Mr. Castle, softly, eyeing
his old mother with misty vision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now!&#8221; spoke the old lady, briskly, &#8220;do
you suppose you could find enough in that pantry
of yours to feed this hungry mob of people in
addition to your regular guests, Lyddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;if they&#8217;ll take &#8216;pot luck,&#8217;&#8221; laughed
Lyddy. &#8220;Literally &#8216;pot luck,&#8217; I mean, for the
piece de resistance will be two huge pots of baked
beans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And such beans!&#8221; exclaimed Grandmother
Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And such &#8216;brown loaf&#8217; to go with them,&#8221;
suggested Harris Colesworth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And old-fashioned &#8216;Injun pudding&#8217; baked in
a brick oven,&#8221; added Mr. Bray, smiling. &#8220;There
is a huge one, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure that there wasn&#8217;t method in
your madness, Mother,&#8221; declared Mr. Castle.
&#8220;All this sounds mighty tempting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it will taste even more tempting,&#8221; declared
the elder Mrs. Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the hamper stay where it is,&#8221; commanded
her son, to the chauffeur. &#8220;We&#8217;ll partake of the
Misses Bray&#8217;s hospitality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger Castles, and the gentleman&#8217;s wife,
might have been in some doubt at first; but when
they were set down to the long dining table, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
Lyddy&#8217;s hot viands steaming on the cloth&#8211;with
the flowers, and beautiful old damask, and blue-and-white
china of a by-gone day, and the heavy
silver, and the brightness and cheerfulness of it
all, they, too, became enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most delightful place to visit we&#8217;ve
ever found,&#8221; declared Miss Virginia Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too sweet for anything,&#8221; agreed Miss
Lucy. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll come this way in the car
again, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we will if Grandma is going to make
this her headquarters&#8211;and she declares she&#8217;s going
to stay,&#8221; said Master Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you blame her?&#8221; returned his father, with
a sigh of plenitude, as he pushed back from the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I can&#8217;t convince myself that she ought
to stay here; but you&#8217;re all against me, I see,&#8221; said
their mother. &#8220;And, it really <i>is</i> a delightful
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bray girls were proud of their success in
satisfying such a party; and Lyddy was particularly
pleased when Mr. Castle drew her aside and
put a ten-dollar note in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word! It was worth it. I only
hope you won&#8217;t be over-run by auto parties and
your place be spoiled. If you have any others,
however, charge them enough. It is better entertainment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
than we could possibly get at any
road house for the same money.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Lyddy got ten dollars toward her
kitchen range.</p>

<p>While the ladies were getting into the tonneau,
however, Miss Bray overheard a few words &#8217;twixt
Harris Colesworth and young Tom Castle that
made her suspicious. She came out upon the side
porch to wave them good-bye with the dish-cloth,
and there were Harris and Tom directly beneath
her.</p>

<p>And they did not observe Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, old man,&#8221; Master Tom was saying,
as he wrung the young chemist&#8217;s hand. &#8220;The
governor and I <i>were</i> a bit worried about grandma,
and your tip came in the nick of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he added, with a chuckle, &#8220;I had no
end of trouble getting Mom and the girls to let
James come up this way. You see, they&#8217;d never
been this way over the hill before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Lyddy to herself, when the boys
had passed out of hearing, &#8220;here is another case
where this Harris Colesworth deliberately put his&#8211;his
<i>nose</i> into other people&#8217;s business!</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew these Castles. At least, he knew
that they belonged to grandma. And he took it
upon himself to be a talebearer. I don&#8217;t like him!
I declare I never <i>shall</i> really like him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>&#8220;Of course, perhaps grandma&#8217;s son and the
rest of the family might be getting anxious about
her. But suppose they&#8217;d been nasty about it and
tried to make her go home with them?</p>

<p>&#8220;No. &#8217;Phemie is always saying Harris Colesworth
has &#8216;such a nice nose.&#8217; It is nothing of
the kind! It is too much in other people&#8217;s business
to suit me,&#8221; quoth Lyddy, with decision.</p>

<p>Her opinion of him, however, did not feaze
Harris in the least. Mr. Somers was inclined to
be stiff and &#8220;offish&#8221; since the previous evening,
but Harris was jolly, and kept everybody cheered
up&#8211;even grandma, who was undoubtedly a little
woe-begone after her family had departed&#8211;for a
while, at least.</p>

<p>It was a little too cool yet to sit out of doors
after sunset, and that evening after supper they
gathered about a clear, brisk fire on the dining-room
hearth, and Harris Colesworth led the conversation.</p>

<p>And perhaps he had an ulterior design in leading
the talk to the Widow Harrison&#8217;s troubles. He
said nothing at which Jud Spink could take offense,
but it seemed that Harris had informed himself
regarding the old woman&#8217;s life with her peculiar
husband, and he knew much about Bob Harrison
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say&#8211;he was a caution&#8211;he was!&#8221; cried Harris.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
&#8220;And he kept folks guessing all about
here for years. The Pritchetts say Bob was a
ne&#8217;er-do-well when he was a boy&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is quite so,&#8221; put in Professor Spink.
&#8220;I can remember the way the old folks talked
about him when I was a boy about here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; agreed Harris. &#8220;He made out he
was entitled to a pension from the government,
for years. And he always told folks he had
brought a fortune home from the war with him.
Let on that he had hidden it about the house, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Spink&#8217;s eyes snapped, and he leaned
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t reckon there is anything in that
story; do you, Mr. Colesworth?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I don&#8217;t&#8211;know,&#8221; said Harris, slowly,
but with a perfectly grave face. &#8220;As I make it
out, when the old fellow died the widow made
search for this hidden treasure he had hinted
at so often; but when the lawyers found out that
he was entitled to no pension&#8211;that he&#8217;d lied
about <i>that</i>&#8211;and that about all he had left her was
a mortgage on the place, Mrs. Harrison gave up
the search for money in disgust. She said as he&#8217;d
lied about the pension, and about other things,
why, of course he&#8217;d lied about the hidden treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t you think he did?&#8221; asked Spink,
with so much interest that the others were amused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; responded Harris, gravely. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know. He <i>might</i> have hidden bonds&#8211;or
deeds&#8211;or even bank notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bray, laughing.
&#8220;That&#8217;s imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not mind, Professor,&#8221; said old Mr.
Colesworth, sharply. &#8220;If there is money, or
treasure, hidden there in the house, or on the
place, and you have bid the place in, as I understand
you have, it will be &#8216;treasure trove&#8217;&#8211;it will
belong to you&#8211;if you find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; ejaculated Professor Spink, darting the
old gentleman rather an angry glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether it is altogether talk and
imagination, or not,&#8221; said Harris, ruminatively.
&#8220;Cyrus Pritchett was with Bob Harrison when
he died. And he says the old man talked of this
hidden money&#8211;or treasure&#8211;or what-not&#8211;up
to the very time be became unconscious. He had
a shock, you know, and it stopped his speech like
<i>that</i>,&#8221; and Harris snapped his finger and thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like a story-book,&#8221; said Grandma
Castle, complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t sound sensible,&#8221; observed Lyddy,
drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving it to you for what it&#8217;s worth,&#8221;
remarked Harris, good-naturedly. &#8220;Mr. Pritchett
was sitting up with Harrison when the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
man had his final shock. Harrison had been
mumbling along to Cyrus about what he wanted
done with certain of his possessions. And he
says:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s that hid away that will be wuth
money&#8211;five thousand in hard cash&#8211;some day,
Cy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the words he used,&#8221; said Harris,
earnestly, and watching Professor Spink from one
corner of his eye. &#8220;He was sitting up, Cy said,
and as he spoke he pointed at&#8213; Well,&#8221; broke
off Harris, abruptly, &#8220;never mind what he pointed
at. He died before he could finish what he was
saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the truth, Harris Colesworth?&#8221; demanded
&#8217;Phemie, regarding him seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got it from Lucas. Then I asked his father.
That is just the way the story was told to me,&#8221;
declared the young fellow, warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8211;and they never found anything?&#8221;
asked Mr. Bray.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They searched. They searched the
old pieces of&#8211;of furniture, too. But Mrs. Harrison
gave it up when it was found that Bob had
been such a&#8211;a prevaricator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He probably lied about the fortune,&#8221; said Mr.
Bray, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;maybe,&#8221; grunted Harris.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>But Lyddy remembered that Harris had
already told her that he proposed to go to the
vendue and buy in several pieces of the widow&#8217;s
furniture. Did that mean that Harris really
thought he had a clue to the hidden treasure?</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VENDUE</span></h2>

<p>Lucas Pritchett drove into the yard with
the two-seated buckboard about nine o&#8217;clock the
next forenoon. And, wonders of wonders! his
mother sat on the front seat beside him.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie ran out in a hurry. Lyddy was getting
ready to go to the vendue. She wanted
to bid in that Dutch oven&#8211;and some other
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mrs. Pritchett!&#8221; exclaimed the younger
Bray girl, &#8220;you are welcome! You haven&#8217;t been
here for an age.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett looked pretty grim; but &#8217;Phemie
found it was tears that made her eyes wink so
fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never been here but onct since you
gals came. And I&#8217;m ashamed of myself,&#8221; said
&#8220;Maw&#8221; Pritchett. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll overlook
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake! how you talk!&#8221; gasped
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it true you gals have saved that poor old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
critter from the farm?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Pritchett,
earnestly, and letting the tears run unchecked
down her fat cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Widder Harrison, she means,&#8221; grunted Lucas.
&#8220;It all come out yesterday at church. The
widder told about it herself. The parson got
hold of it, and he put it into his sermon. And
by cracky! some of those folks that treated ye
so mean at the schoolhouse, Saturday night, feel
pretty cheap after what the parson said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if my Sairy ever says a mean word to one
o&#8217; you gals&#8211;or as much as <i>looks</i> one,&#8221; cried
Mother Pritchett, &#8220;big as she is an&#8217;,&#8211;an&#8217;, yes&#8211;<i>old</i>
as she is, I&#8217;ll spank her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Pritchett! Lucas!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so. You&#8217;re making it up out of whole
cloth. We haven&#8217;t really done a thing for Mrs.
Harrison&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve thought to take her in and give her a
home&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I am sure she will earn her living
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But none of us&#8211;folks that had knowed her
for years&#8211;thought to give the poor old critter
a chanst,&#8221; burst out the lady. &#8220;Oh, I know
Cyrus wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; heard to our taking her; and I
dunno as we could have exactly afforded it, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
me an&#8217; Sairy is amply able to do the work; but
our Ladies&#8217; Aid never thought to do a thing for
her&#8211;nor nobody else,&#8221; declared Mrs. Pritchett.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two gals was ministerin&#8217; angels. I don&#8217;t
suppose we none of us really knowed how Mis&#8217;
Harrison felt about going to the poorhouse. But
we didn&#8217;t inquire none, either.</p>

<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s Lyddy! My dear, I&#8217;m too fat
to get down easy. I hope you&#8217;ll come and shake
hands with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;certainly,&#8221; responded Lyddy. &#8220;And
I am really glad to see you, dear Mrs. Pritchett.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had evidently overheard some, if not all,
of the good lady&#8217;s earnest speech. Harris Colesworth
appeared, too, and Professor Spink was
right behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stopped for me, as I asked you to,
Lucas?&#8221; asked the young chemist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Mr. Colesworth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Lydia is going, too,&#8221; said the young
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll fill the bill, then, sir,&#8221; said Lucas,
grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say!&#8221; exclaimed the professor, suddenly.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you squeeze <i>me</i> in? I&#8217;m going
over the hill, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see how it kin be done, Professor,&#8221; said
Lucas.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>&#8220;But you said you thought that there&#8217;d be an
extra seat&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know maw was going, then,&#8221; replied
the unabashed Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Somers has driven off to school with
his old mare,&#8221; exclaimed Spink.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he has,&#8221; observed Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a pretty pass!&#8221; and Mr. Spink was
evidently angry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i> to get to that
vendue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to walk&#8211;and it&#8217;s advertised
to begin in ha&#8217;f an hour,&#8221; quoth Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say! where&#8217;s your other rig?&#8221; demanded the
professor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hire it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s plowin&#8217; with the big team,&#8221; said Lucas,
flicking the backs of the ponies with his whip, as
they started, &#8220;and our old mare is lame. Gid-up!</p>

<p>&#8220;That Jud Spink is gittin&#8217; jest as pop&#8217;lar &#8217;round
here as a pedlar sellin&#8217; mustard plasters in the
lower regions!&#8221; observed young Pritchett, as they
whirled out of the yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Lucas Pritchett! how you talk!&#8221;
gasped his mother.</p>

<p>The widow&#8217;s auction sale&#8211;or &#8220;vendue&#8221;&#8211;brought
together, as such affairs usually do in the
country, more people, and aroused a deal more interest,
than does a funeral.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>There was a goodly crowd before the little
house, or moving idly through the half-dismantled
lower rooms when Lucas halted the ponies to let
Harris and the ladies out.</p>

<p>To Lyddy&#8217;s surprise, the women present&#8211;or
most of them&#8211;welcomed her with more warmth
than she had experienced in a greeting since she
and her sister had first come to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>But the auctioneer began to put up the household
articles for sale very soon and that relieved
Lyddy of some embarrassment in meeting these
folk who so suddenly had veered toward her.</p>

<p>There were only a few things the girl could
afford to buy. The Dutch oven was the most important;
and fortunately most of the farmers&#8217;
wives had stoves in their kitchens, so there was
not much bidding. Lyddy had it nocked down
to her for sixty cents.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison seemed very sad to see some of
her things go, and Lyddy believed that every
article that the widow seemed particularly anxious
about, young Harris Colesworth bid in.</p>

<p>At least, he bought a bureau, a worktable, an
old rocking chair with stuffed back and cushion,
and last of all an old, age-darkened, birdseye
maple desk, which seemed shaky and half-ready
to fall to pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;That article ought to bring ye in a forchune,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
Mr. Colesworth,&#8221; declared the auctioneer, cheerfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s where they say Bob hid his
forchune&#8211;yessir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it looks&#8211;from the back of it&#8211;that
worms had got inter the forchune,&#8221; chuckled one
of the farmers, as the wood-worm dust rattled out
of the old contraption when Harris and Lucas carried
it out and set it down with the other articles
Harris had bought.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you got it; did you, young man?&#8221; snarled
a voice behind the two youths, and there stood
Professor Spink.</p>

<p>He was much heated, his boots and trousers
were muddy, and his frock coat had a bad, three-cornered
tear in it. Evidently he had come across
lots&#8211;and he had hurried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;were you interested in that old desk I
bought in?&#8221; asked Harris with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give ye a dollar for your bargain,&#8221; blurted
out the professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you honest, I didn&#8217;t pay but two dollars
for it,&#8221; replied Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll double it&#8211;give you four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I guess I&#8217;ll keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five,&#8221; snapped the breakfast food magnate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; responded Harris, turning away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work! keep it up!&#8221; Lyddy heard Lucas
whisper to the other youth. &#8220;I bet I kin tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
jest what dad told him. Dad&#8217;s jest close-mouthed
enough to make the professor fidgetty. He begins
to believe it all now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; warned Harris.</p>

<p>The next moment the anxious professor was at
him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want that desk, Colesworth. I&#8217;ll give you
ten dollars for it&#8211;fifteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Harris, in apparent disgust, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell you the truth; I bought that desk&#8211;and these
other things&#8211;to give back to old Mrs. Harrison.
She seemed to set store by them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the desk is hers. If she wants to sell
it for twenty-five dollars&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hush up! I&#8217;ll make my own bargain
with her,&#8221; growled the professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No you won&#8217;t, by jove!&#8221; exclaimed the city
youth. &#8220;If you want the desk you&#8217;ll pay all its
worth. Hey! Mrs. Harrison!&#8221;</p>

<p>The widow approached, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made up my mind,&#8221; said Harris, hurriedly,
&#8220;that I&#8217;d give you these things here. You
might like to have them in your room at Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, young man!&#8221; returned the
widow, flushing. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what makes you
young folks so kind to me&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>&#8220;Hold on! there&#8217;s something else,&#8221; interrupted
Harris. &#8220;Now, Professor Spink here wants to
buy that desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll give ye a good price for it, Widder,&#8221;
said Spink. &#8220;I want it to remember Bob by.
I&#8217;ll give you&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s already offered me twenty-five dollars
for it&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Spink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then, you don&#8217;t want it, after all,&#8221; returned
Harris, coolly. &#8220;I thought you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! suppose I do offer you twenty-five for
it, Mis&#8217; Harrison?&#8221; exclaimed Spink, evidently
greatly spurred by desire, yet curbed by his own
natural penuriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my advice and bid him up, Mrs. Harrison,&#8221;
said Harris, with a wink. &#8220;He knows
more about this old desk than he ought to, it
seems to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake&#8213;&#8221; began the widow;
but Spink burst forth in a rage:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make ye a last offer for it&#8211;you can
take it or leave it.&#8221; He drew forth a wad
of bills and peeled off several into the widow&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s fifty dollars. Is the desk mine?&#8221; he
fairly yelled.</p>

<p>The vociferous speech of the professor drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
people from the auction. They gathered around.
Harris nodded to the old lady, and her hand
clamped upon the bills.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, this is Mrs. Harrison&#8217;s own
money,&#8221; said young Colesworth, evenly. &#8220;The
desk was bought at auction for two dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is it mine?&#8221; demanded Spink.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is yours, Jud Spink,&#8221; replied the old lady,
stuffing the money into her handbag.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimme that hatchet!&#8221; cried the professor,
seizing the implement from a man who stood by.
He attacked the old desk in a fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Harrison.
&#8220;I <i>did</i> want the old thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spink grinned at them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you both
sicker than you be!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;Out o&#8217; the
way!&#8221;</p>

<p>He banged the desk two or three more clips&#8211;and
out fell a secret panel in the back of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;By cracky! money&#8211;real money!&#8221; yelled
Lucas Pritchett. &#8220;Oh, Mr. Harris! we done it
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>For from the shallow opening behind the panel
there were scattered upon the ground several
packets of apparently brand-new, if somewhat discolored
banknotes.</p>

<p>Professor Spink dropped the axe and picked up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
the packages eagerly. Others crowded around.
They ran them over quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five thousand dollars&#8211;if there&#8217;s a cent!&#8221;
gasped somebody, in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she sold it for fifty dollars,&#8221; said Lucas,
almost in tears.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PROFESSOR SPINK&#8217;S BOTTLES</span></h2>

<p>But Professor Lemuel Judson Spink did not
look happy&#8211;not at all!</p>

<p>While the neighbors were crowding around,
emitting &#8220;ohs&#8221; and &#8220;ahs&#8221; over his find in the
broken old desk, the proprietor of &#8220;the breakfast
for the million&#8221; began to look pretty sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five thousand dollars! My mercy!&#8221; gasped
the Widow Harrison. &#8220;Then Bob <i>didn&#8217;t</i> lie
about bringing home that fortune when he came
from the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame, Widder!&#8221; cried one man.
&#8220;That five thousand ought to belong to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad got it right; didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Lucas,
shaking his head sadly. &#8220;He allus said Harrison
was trying to tell him where it was hid when
he had his last stroke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harris Colesworth spoke for the first time since
the packages of notes were discovered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harrison told Cyrus Pritchett that he
had hid away &#8216;that that would be wuth five thousand.&#8217;
It&#8217;s plain what he had in his mind&#8211;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
a whole lot of other foolish people had it in their
minds just after the Civil War.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Mr. Colesworth?&#8221; cried
Lyddy, who was clinging to the widow&#8217;s hand
and patting it soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; chuckled Harris, &#8220;there were folks
who believed&#8211;and they believed it for years after
the Civil War&#8211;that some day the Federal Government
was going to redeem all the paper money
printed by the Confederate States&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; bawled Lucas, fairly springing off
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confederate money?&#8221; repeated the crowd in
chorus.</p>

<p>No wonder Professor Spink looked sick. He
broke through the group, flinging the neat packages
of bills behind him as he strode away.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the desk, Professor?&#8221; shouted
Harris; &#8220;don&#8217;t you want it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to the old woman&#8211;you swindler!&#8221;
snarled Spink.</p>

<p>And then the crowd roared! The humor of
the thing struck them and it was half an hour
before the auctioneer could go on with the sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I did not know the bills were there,&#8221;
Harris avowed. &#8220;But I thought the professor
was so avaricious that he could be made to bid
up the old desk. Had he bid on it when it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
put up by the auctioneer, however, Mrs. Harrison
would not have benefited. You see, the best
the auctioneer can do, what he gets from the sale
will not entirely satisfy Spink&#8217;s claim. But the
money-grabber can&#8217;t touch that fifty dollars in
good money he paid over to Mrs. Harrison with
his own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was splendid, Harris!&#8221; gasped Lyddy,
seizing both his hands. Then she retired suddenly
to Mrs. Harrison&#8217;s side and never said another
word to the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, cracky!&#8221; said Lucas, with a sigh. &#8220;I
was scairt stiff when I seen them bills fall out of
the old desk. I thought sure they were good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess I knew what they were immediately&#8211;and
so did Spink,&#8221; replied Harris.</p>

<p>The young folks had got enough of the vendue
now, and so had Mrs. Pritchett. Lucas agreed
to come up with the farm wagon for the pieces
of furniture with which Harris had presented
the Widow Harrison&#8211;including the broken desk&#8211;and
transport them and the widow herself to
Hillcrest before night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pritchett was enthusiastic over the girls
taking Mrs. Harrison to the farm, and she could
not say enough in praise of it. So Lyddy was
glad to get out of the buckboard with Harris
Colesworth at the bottom of the lane.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>&#8220;You all talk too much about it, Mrs. Pritchett!&#8221;
she cried, when bidding the farmer&#8217;s wife
good-bye. &#8220;But I&#8217;d be glad to have you come
up here as often as you can&#8211;and talk on any
other subject!&#8221; and she ran laughing into the
house.</p>

<p>Lyddy feared that Professor Spink would make
trouble. At least, he and Harris Colesworth must
be at swords&#8217; point. And she was sorry now
that she had so impulsively given the young
chemist her commendation for what he had done
for the Widow Harrison.</p>

<p>However, Harris went off at noon, walking
to town to take the afternoon train to the city;
and as the professor did not show up again until
nightfall there was no friction that day at Hillcrest&#8211;nor
for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harrison came and got into the work
&#8220;two-fisted,&#8221; as she said herself. She was a
strong old woman, and had been brought up to
work. Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie were at once relieved
of many hard jobs&#8211;and none too quickly, for the
girls were growing thin under the burden they
had assumed.</p>

<p>That very week their advertisements brought
them a gentleman and his wife with a little
crippled daughter. It was getting warm enough
now so that people were not afraid to come to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
board in a house that had no heating arrangements
but open fireplaces.</p>

<p>As the numbers of the boarders increased, however,
Lyddy did not find that the profit increased
proportionately. She was now handling fifty-one
dollars and a half each week; but the demands
for vegetables and fresh eggs made a big item;
and as yet there had been no returns from the
garden, although everything was growing splendidly.</p>

<p>The chickens had hatched&#8211;seventy-two of
them. Mr. Bray had taken up the study of the
poultry papers and catalogs, and he declared himself
well enough to take entire charge of the
fluffy little fellows as soon as they came from
the shell. He really did appear to be getting on
a little; but the girls watched him closely and
could scarcely believe that he made any material
gain in health.</p>

<p>With Harris Colesworth&#8217;s help one Saturday,
he had knocked together a couple of home-made
brooders and movable runs, and soon the flock,
divided in half, were chirping gladly in the spring
sunshine on the side lawn.</p>

<p>They fed them scientifically, and with care.
Mr. Bray was at the pens every two hours all
day&#8211;or oftener. At night, two jugs of hot water
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
went into the brooders, and the little biddies never
seemed to miss having a real mother.</p>

<p>Luckily Lyddy had chosen a hardy strain of
fowl and during the first fortnight they lost only
two of the fluffy little fellows. Lyddy saw the
beginning of a profitable chicken business ahead of
her; but, of course, it was only an expense as yet.</p>

<p>She could not see her way clear to buying the
kitchen range that was so much needed; and the
days were growing warmer. May promised to
be the forerunner of an exceedingly hot summer.</p>

<p>At Hillcrest there was, however, almost always
a breeze. Seldom did the huge piles of rocks at
the back of the farm shut the house off from the
cooling winds. The people who came to enjoy
the simple comforts of the farmhouse were loud
in their praises of the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can get along till July&#8211;or even the
last of June,&#8221; quoth Lyddy to her sister, &#8220;I feel
sure that we will get the house well filled, the
garden will help to support us, and we shall be
on the way to making a good living&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we aren&#8217;t dead,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;I <i>do</i>
get so tired sometimes. It&#8217;s a blessing we got
Mother Harrison,&#8221; for so they had come to call
the widow.</p>

<p>&#8220;We knew we&#8217;d have to work if we took
boarders,&#8221; said Lyddy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8220;Goodness me! we didn&#8217;t know we had to
work our fingers to the bone&#8211;mine are coming
through the flesh&#8211;the bones, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know I have lost ten pounds. I&#8217;m
only a skeleton. You could hang me up in that
closet in the old doctor&#8217;s office in place of that
skeleton&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s <i>that</i>, &#8217;Phemie Bray?&#8221; demanded the
older sister, in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie realized that she had almost let <i>that</i>
secret out of the bag, and she jumped up with
a sudden cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy! do you know the time, Lyd? If
we&#8217;re going to pick those wild strawberries for
tea, we&#8217;d better be off at once. It&#8217;s almost three
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so she escaped telling Lyddy all she knew
about what was behind the mysteriously locked
green door at the end of the long corridor of the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>Harris Colesworth, on his early Sunday morning
jaunts to the swimming-hole in Pounder&#8217;s
Brook, had discovered a patch of wild strawberries,
and had told the girls. Up to this time
Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie had found little time in which
to walk over the farm. As for traversing the
rocky part of it, as old Mr. Colesworth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
Professor Spink did, that was out of the question.</p>

<p>But fruit was high, and the chance to pick a
dish for supper&#8211;enough for all the boarders&#8211;was
a great temptation to the frugal Lyddy.</p>

<p>She caught up her sunbonnet and pail and followed
her sister. &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s bonnet was blue and
Lyddy&#8217;s was pink. As they crossed the cornfield,
their bright tin pails flashing in the afternoon sunlight,
Grandma Castle saw them from the shady
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about those two girls,
Mrs. Chadwick?&#8221; she demanded of the little lame
girl&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been here so short a time I scarcely
know how to answer that question, Mrs. Castle,&#8221;
responded the other lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you: They&#8217;re wonderful!&#8221; declared
Grandma Castle. &#8220;If my granddaughters had
half the get-up-and-get to &#8217;em that Lydia and
Euphemia have, I&#8217;d be as proud as Mrs. Lucifer!
So I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girls of Hillcrest Farm had
passed through the young corn&#8211;acres and acres of
it, running clear down to Mr. Pritchett&#8217;s line&#8211;and
climbed the stone fence into the upper
pasture.</p>

<p>Here a path, winding among the huge boulders,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
brought them within sound of Pounder&#8217;s Brook.
&#8217;Phemie laughed now at the remembrance of her
intimate acquaintance with that brook the day
they had first come to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>It broadened here in a deep brown pool under
an overhanging boulder. A big beech tree, too,
shaded it. It certainly was a most attractive
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I was a boy!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie, in delight.
&#8220;I certainly would get a bathing suit and
come up here like Harris Colesworth. And
Lucas comes here and plunges in after his day&#8217;s
work&#8211;he told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! I hope nobody will come here for
a bath just now,&#8221; observed Lyddy. &#8220;It would
be rather awkward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I reckon the water&#8217;s cold, too,&#8221; agreed
her sister, with a giggle. &#8220;This stream is fed
by a dozen different springs around among the
rocks here, so Lucas says. And I expect one
spring is just a little colder than another!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; exclaimed Lyddy. &#8220;There are
the strawberries.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls were down upon their knees immediately,
picking into their tins&#8211;and their mouths.
They could not resist the luscious berries&#8211;&#8220;tame&#8221;
strawberries never can be as sweet as the
wild kind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>And this patch near the swimming hole afforded
a splendid crop. The girls saw that they might
come here again and again to pick berries for their
table&#8211;and every free boon of Nature like this
helped in the management of the boarding house!</p>

<p>But suddenly&#8211;when their kettles were near
full&#8211;&#8217;Phemie jumped up with a shrill whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, &#8217;Phemie!&#8221; exclaimed her sister.
&#8220;How you scared me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush yourself! don&#8217;t you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy did. Surely that was a strange clinking
noise to be heard up here in the woods. It
sounded like a milkman going along the street
carrying a bunch of empty bottles.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wild animal&#8211;unless he&#8217;s got glass
teeth and is gnashing &#8217;em,&#8221; giggled &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;Come on! I want to know what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, &#8217;Phemie&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>I</i> would, Lyddy. Come on! Who&#8217;s
afraid of bottles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>is</i> it bottles we hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out in a jiff,&#8221; declared her younger
sister, leading the way deeper into the woods.</p>

<p>The sound was from up stream. They followed
the noisy brook for some hundreds of
yards. Then they came suddenly upon a little
hollow, where water dripped over a huge boulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
into another still pool&#8211;but smaller than the swimming
hole.</p>

<p>Behind the drip of the water was a ledge, and
on this ledge stood a row of variously assorted
bottles. A man was just setting several other
bottles on the same ledge.</p>

<p>These were the bottles the girls had heard
striking together as the man walked through the
woods. And the man himself was Professor
Spink.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE OLD DOCTOR&#8217;S OFFICE</span></h2>

<p>The two girls, almost at once, began to shrink
away through the bushes again&#8211;and this without
a word or look having passed between them.
Both Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie were unwilling to meet
the professor under these conditions.</p>

<p>They were back at the strawberry patch before
either of them spoke aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>do</i> you suppose he was about?&#8221; whispered
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know? And those bottles!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think was in them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looked like water&#8211;nothing but water,&#8221; said
Lyddy. &#8220;It certainly <i>is</i> a puzzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any sense in it,&#8221;
cried Lyddy. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go home, &#8217;Phemie. We&#8217;ve
got enough berries for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they went along the pasture trail, the younger
girl suggested:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he could be making up another
of his fake medicines? Like those &#8216;Stonehedge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
Bitters?&#8217; Lucas says they ought to be
called &#8217;<i>Stonefence</i> Bitters,&#8217; for they are just hard
cider and bad whiskey&#8211;and that&#8217;s what the folks
hereabout call &#8216;stonefence.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked like only water in those bottles,&#8221;
Lyddy said, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s so afraid old Mr. Colesworth&#8211;or
Harris&#8211;will come up here and find him at work&#8211;or
come across his water-bottles,&#8221; continued
&#8217;Phemie. &#8220;Lucky this new boarder&#8211;Mr. Chadwick&#8211;isn&#8217;t
much for long walks. It would keep
old Spink busier than a hen on a hot griddle, as
Lucas says, to watch all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wish I knew what it meant. It puzzles
me,&#8221; remarked Lyddy. &#8220;And I never yet
asked Mr. Pritchett about the evening we saw
him and a man whom I now think must have been
Professor Spink at the farmhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him&#8211;do,&#8221; urged &#8217;Phemie, at last curious
enough to have Lyddy share all the mystery that
had been troubling her own mind since they first
came to Hillcrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do so the very first time I see him,&#8221;
declared Lyddy.</p>

<p>But something else happened first&#8211;and something
that brought the mystery regarding Professor
Lemuel Judson Spink to a head for the
time being, at least.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>&#8217;Phemie lost the key to the green door!</p>

<p>Now, off and on, that missing key had troubled
Lyddy. She had seldom spoken of it, for she
had never even known it had been in the door
when the girls came to Hillcrest. Only &#8217;Phemie,
it will be remembered, had the midnight adventure
in the old doctor&#8217;s suite of offices in the east
wing.</p>

<p>Lyddy only said, occasionally, that it was odd
Aunt Jane had not sent the key to the green door
when she expressed all the other keys to her
nieces when the project of keeping boarders at
Hillcrest was first broached.</p>

<p>At these times &#8217;Phemie had kept as still as a
mouse. Sometimes the key was worn on a string
around her neck; sometimes it was concealed in
a cunning little pocket she had sewn into her skirt.
But wherever it was, it always seemed&#8211;to &#8217;Phemie&#8211;to
be burning a hole in her garments and
trying to make its appearance.</p>

<p>After finding Professor Spink filling the bottles
with water up by Pounder&#8217;s Brook, the girl was
more than usually troubled about the east wing
and the mystery.</p>

<p>She moved the key about from place to place.
One day she wore it; another she hid it in
some corner. And finally, one night when she
came to go to bed, she found that the cord on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
which she had worn the key that day was broken
and the key was gone.</p>

<p>She screamed so loud at this discovery that her
sister was sure she had seen a mouse, and she
bounded into bed, half dressed as she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8211;where is it, &#8217;Phemie?&#8221; she gasped,
for Lyddy was as afraid of mice as she was of
rats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy me!&#8221; wailed &#8217;Phemie, &#8220;that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;d like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see it?&#8221; cried her trembling sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; returned &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>Lyddy got gingerly down from the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d like to know what you yelled so for&#8211;if
the mouse has disappeared?&#8221; she demanded,
quite sternly.</p>

<p>And then &#8217;Phemie, understanding her, and realizing
that she had almost given her secret away,
burst into a hysterical giggle, which nothing but
Lyddy&#8217;s shaking finally relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just as twittery as a sparrow,&#8221; declared
Lyddy. &#8220;I never <i>did</i> see such a girl.
First you&#8217;re squealing as though you were hurt,
and then you laugh in a most idiotic way. Come!
do behave yourself and go to bed!&#8221;</p>

<p>But even after &#8217;Phemie obeyed she could not go
to sleep.</p>

<p>Suppose somebody picked up that key? She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>
had no idea, of course, where it had been dropped.
Certainly not on the floor of her bedroom.
Some time during the day, inside, or outside of
the house, the key, with its little brass tag stamped
with the words &#8220;East Wing,&#8221; had slipped to the
ground.</p>

<p>Now&#8211;suppose it was found?</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie got out of bed quietly, slipped on her
slippers and shrugged herself into her robe. Somebody
might be down there in old Dr. Phelps&#8217;s
offices right now.</p>

<p>And that somebody, of course, in &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
mind, meant just one person&#8211;Professor Lemuel
Judson Spink.</p>

<p>Why had he come to Hillcrest to board, anyway?
And why hadn&#8217;t he gone away when he had
been made the topic of many a joke about old Bob
Harrison&#8217;s treasure trove?</p>

<p>For nearly a fortnight now the professor had
stood grimly the jokes and laughing comments
aimed at him by the other boarders. The
presence of Mrs. Harrison, too, in the house, was
a constant reminder to the breakfast food magnate
of how his own acquisitiveness had made him
over-reach himself.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie went downstairs, taking a comforter
with her, and went into the long corridor leading
from the west wing entry to the green door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
The girls had never taken the old davenport out
of this wide hall, and &#8217;Phemie curled up on this&#8211;with
its hard, hair-cloth-covered arm for a pillow&#8211;spread
the quilt over her, and tried to compose
her nerves here within sight and sound of the
east wing entrance.</p>

<p>Suppose somebody was already in the offices?</p>

<p>The thought became so insistent that, after
ten minutes, she was forced to creep along to the
green door and try the latch.</p>

<p>With her hand on it, she heard a sudden sound
from the room nearby. Was somebody astir in
the Colesworth quarters?</p>

<p>This was late Saturday night&#8211;almost midnight,
in fact; and of course Harris Colesworth
was in the house. Sometimes he read until very
late.</p>

<p>So &#8217;Phemie turned again, after a moment, and
lifted the latch. Then she pushed tentatively on
the door, and&#8213;</p>

<p><i>It swung open!</i></p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie gasped&#8211;an appalling sound it seemed
in the stillness of the corridor and at that hour
of the night.</p>

<p>Often, while the key had been in her possession,
she had tried the door as she passed it while working
about the house. It had been securely locked.</p>

<p>Then, she told herself now, on the instant, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
key had been found and it had been put to use.
Somebody had already been in the old doctor&#8217;s
offices and had ransacked the rooms.</p>

<p>She crossed the threshold swiftly and groped
her way to the door of the second room&#8211;the old
doctor&#8217;s consulting room. Here the light of the
moon filtered through the shutters sufficiently to
show her the place.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nobody there, and she
stepped in, leaving the green door open behind
her, but pulling shut the door between the anteroom
and the office.</p>

<p>There was the old doctor&#8217;s big desk, and the
bookcases all about the room, and the jars with
&#8220;specimens&#8221; in them and&#8211;yes!&#8211;the skeleton
case in the corner.</p>

<p>She had advanced to the middle of the room
when suddenly she saw that the door into the
lumber room, or laboratory, at the back, was open.
A white wand of light shot through this open
door, and played upon the ceiling, then upon the
wall, of the old doctor&#8217;s office.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A BLOW-UP</span></h2>

<p>&#8217;Phemie&#8217;s heart beat quickly; but she was no
more afraid than she had been the moment before,
when she found the green door unlocked. There
was somebody&#8211;the person who had found the
lost key&#8211;still in the offices of the east wing.</p>

<p>The wand of white light playing about her
was from an electric torch. She stooped, and
literally crawled on all fours out of the range of
the light from the rear doorway.</p>

<p>Before she knew it she was right beside the
case containing the skeleton. Indeed, she hid in
its shadow.</p>

<p>And her interest in that moving light&#8211;and the
person behind it&#8211;made her forget her original
terror of what was in the box.</p>

<p>She heard a rustle&#8211;then a step on the boards.
It was a heavy person approaching. The door
opened farther between the workshop and the
room in which she was hidden.</p>

<p>Then she recognized the tall figure entering.
It was as she had expected. It was Professor
Spink.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>The breakfast food magnate came directly
toward the high, locked desk belonging to the
dead and gone physician, who had been a kind
friend and patron of this quack medicine man
when he was a boy.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie had heard all the particulars of Spink&#8217;s
connection with Dr. Polly Phelps. The good old
doctor had been called to attend the boy in some
childish disease while he was an inmate of the
county poorhouse. His parents&#8211;who were
gypsies, or like wanderers&#8211;had deserted the boy
and he had &#8220;gone on the town,&#8221; as the saying
was.</p>

<p>Dr. Polly had taken a fancy to the little fellow.
He was then twelve years old&#8211;or thereabout&#8211;smart
and sharp. The old doctor brought him
home to Hillcrest, sent him to school, made him
useful to him in a dozen ways, and began even
to train him as a doctor.</p>

<p>For five years Jud Spink had remained with the
old physician. Then he had run away with a
medicine show. It was said, too, that he stole
money from Dr. Polly when he went; but the
physician had never said so, nor taken any means
to punish the wayward boy if he returned.</p>

<p>And Jud Spink had never re-appeared in
Bridleburg, or the vicinity, while the old doctor
was alive.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>Then his visits had been few and far between
until, at last, coming back a few months before,
a self-confessed rich man, he had declared his
intention of settling down in the community.</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie Bray believed that the false professor
had come here to Hillcrest for a special
object. He was money-mad&#8211;his avariciousness
had been already well displayed.</p>

<p>She believed that there was something on Hillcrest
that Jud Spink wanted&#8211;something he could
make money out of.</p>

<p>She was not surprised, then, to see a short iron
bar in the professor&#8217;s hand. It was flattened and
sharpened at one end.</p>

<p>By the light of the hand-lamp the man went
to work on the locked desk. It was of heavy
wood&#8211;no flimsy thing like that one which he had
burst open so easily the day of the Widow Harrison&#8217;s
vendue.</p>

<p>The man inserted the sharp end of the jimmy
between the lid and the upper shelf of the desk.
&#8217;Phemie heard the woodwork crack, and this time
she did <i>not</i> suppress a gasp.</p>

<p>Why! this fellow was actually breaking open
the old doctor&#8217;s desk. Aunt Jane had not even
sent <i>them</i> the keys of the desk and bookcases in
this suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Then &#8217;Phemie had a sudden thought. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
really afraid of the big man. She did not know
what he might do to her if he found her here
spying on his actions. And&#8211;she didn&#8217;t want the
lock of the old desk smashed.</p>

<p>She reached up softly and turned with shaking
fingers the old-fashioned wooden button that held
shut the door of the case beside which she
crouched.</p>

<p>She remembered very clearly that it had
snapped open before when she was investigating&#8211;and
with a little click. The door of this case
acted almost as though the hinges had springs
coiled in them.</p>

<p>At once, when she released the door, it swung
open&#8211;and in yawning it <i>did</i> make a suspicious
sound.</p>

<p>Professor Spink started&#8211;he had been about to
bear down on the bar again. He flashed a look
back over his shoulder. But the corner was
shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie sighed&#8211;this time with intent. She
remembered how she had been frightened so herself
at her former visit to this office&#8211;and she
believed the marauder now before her had been
partially the cause of her fright.</p>

<p>The jimmy dropped from Spink&#8217;s hand and
clattered on the floor. He wheeled and shot the
white spot of his lamp into the corner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>By great good fortune the ray of the lantern
missed the girl; but it struck into the yawning
case and intensified the horrid appearance of the
skeleton.</p>

<p>For half a minute Spink stood as if frozen in
his tracks. If he had known the old doctor had
such a possession as the skeleton, he had forgotten
it. Nor did he see any part of the case
that held it, but just the dangling, grinning Thing
itself, revealed by the brilliance of his spotlight,
but with a mass of deep shadow surrounding
it.</p>

<p>Professor Spink had perhaps had many perilous
experiences in his varied life; but never anything
just like <i>this</i>.</p>

<p>He might not have been afraid of a man&#8211;or
a dozen men; no emergency&#8211;which he could talk
out of&#8211;would have feazed him; but a man doesn&#8217;t
feel like trying to talk down a skeleton!</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t even stop to pick up the jimmy. He
shut off the spotlight; and he stumbled over his
own feet in getting to the door.</p>

<p><i>He was running away!</i></p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie was up immediately and after him.
She did not propose for him to get away with that
key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! stop!&#8221; she shouted.</p>

<p>Perhaps Professor Spink verily believed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
the skeleton in the box called after him&#8211;that
it was, indeed, in actual pursuit.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t stop. He didn&#8217;t reply. He went
across the small anteroom and out of the open
green door.</p>

<p>But he had made a lot of noise. A big man
with the fear of the supernatural chilling his
very soul does not tread lightly.</p>

<p>A frightened ox in the place could have made
no more noise. He tumbled over two chairs and
finally went full length over an old hassock. He
brought up with an awful crash against the big
davenport in the corridor, where &#8217;Phemie had
tried to keep watch.</p>

<p>And there, when he tried to scramble up, he
got entangled in &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s quilt and went to the
floor again just as a great light flashed into the
corridor.</p>

<p>The Colesworths&#8217; door stood open. Out
dashed Harris in his pajamas and a robe. He fell
upon the big body of Spink as though he were
making a &#8220;tackle&#8221; in a football game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold him! hold him!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; declared Harris. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the key,&#8221; explained &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;Make him give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Harris, and dexterously twitched
the entangled Spink over on his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jove!&#8221; gasped the young man, standing
up. &#8220;It&#8217;s the professor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s got the key!&#8221; the girl reiterated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What key?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one to the green door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The door of the east wing?&#8221; demanded Harris,
turning to stare at the open door, on the
threshold of which &#8217;Phemie stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I lost it. He found it. He&#8217;s got it
somewhere. I found him trying to break into
grandfather&#8217;s desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad, bad,&#8221; muttered Harris, stepping back
and allowing the professor room to sit up.
&#8220;Your interest in old desks seems to be phenomenal,
Professor. Did you expect to find Confederate
notes in <i>this</i> one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you&#8211;both!&#8221; snarled Spink, slowly
rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it,&#8221; said Harris, quietly. &#8220;But
don&#8217;t include Miss Bray in your emphatic remarks.
<i>Give me that key.</i>&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THEY LOSE A BOARDER</span></h2>

<p>Harris had something beside a square and
determined jaw. He had muscular arms and he
looked just then as though he were ready to use
them. Spink gave him no provocation.</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and brought out a
key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the one, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221; asked the
young fellow.</p>

<p>The girl stepped forward, and in the lamplight
from the bedroom doorway identified the
key of the green door&#8211;with its tag attached.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, then. Go to your room, Professor,&#8221;
said Harris. &#8220;Unless you want him for
something further, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me! No!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;I never want to see him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The professor was already aiming for the stairs,
and he quickly disappeared. Harris turned to
the still shaking girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it all about, Miss &#8217;Phemie?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d really like to know myself,&#8221;
she replied, eagerly. &#8220;He is after something&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So my father says,&#8221; interposed Harris.
&#8220;Father says Spink has something hidden&#8211;or
has made some discovery&#8211;up there in the
rocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether he really has found
what he has been looking for&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that is?&#8221; suggested Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we knew!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;But we
don&#8217;t. At least, <i>I</i> don&#8217;t&#8211;nor does Lyddy. But
he tried to buy the farm of Aunt Jane once&#8211;only
he offered a very small price.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been hanging around here for months
trying to find something. He got into the old
offices to-night, and tried to break into grandfather&#8217;s
desk&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Harris nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to look into this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
hope you and your sister will not refuse my aid.
This Spink may be more of a knave than a fool.
Now, go back to bed and&#8211;and assure Miss Lyddy
that I will be only too glad to help &#8216;thwart the
villain&#8217;&#8211;if he really has some plan to better himself
at your expense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie picked up her quilt, locked the green
door, and returned to her room. Throughout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
all the excitement Lyddy had slept; but &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
coming to bed aroused her.</p>

<p>The younger girl was too shaken by what had
transpired to hide her excitement, and Lyddy
quickly was broad awake listening to &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s
story. The latter told all that had happened,
including her experiences on the night they had
come to Hillcrest. There was no sleep for the
two girls just then&#8211;not, at least, until they had
discussed Professor Spink and the secret of the
rocks at the back of the farm, from every possible
angle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall tell him that his absence will be better
appreciated than his company&#8211;at once!&#8221; declared
Lyddy, finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;But sending him away isn&#8217;t going to explain
the mystery,&#8221; wailed &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>In the morning, before many of the other boarders
were astir, the two girls caught the oily professor
just starting off with a handbag.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get the remainder of your baggage
ready to go too, sir,&#8221; said Lyddy, sharply,
&#8220;for we don&#8217;t want you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s packed, young lady,&#8221; returned Professor
Spink, with a sneer. &#8220;I shall send a man for it
from the hotel in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, <i>that&#8217;s</i> all right,&#8221; quoth the girl, warmly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve paid your board in advance, and I cannot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
complain. But I would like to have you explain
what your actions last night mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. I
heard people moving about the house and&#8211;naturally&#8211;I
went to see&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you story-teller!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I can see that you have both made up
your minds not to believe me,&#8221; said the odd
boarder, haughtily. &#8220;Good-morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I honestly believe we ought to get a warrant
out and have him arrested,&#8221; observed the older
girl, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for? I don&#8217;t believe he took anything,&#8221;
said &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! he was trying to break into grandfather&#8217;s
desk, just the same,&#8221; said Lyddy, and
then Harris Colesworth joined them.</p>

<p>Now, Lyddy believed that this young man was
altogether too prone to meddle with other
people&#8217;s affairs; yet ever since the Widow Harrison&#8217;s
vendue she had been more friendly with
Harris.</p>

<p>And now when he began to talk about the
professor and his strange actions over night, she
could only thank the young chemist for his assistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we have no idea that that man
took anything,&#8221; she concluded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>&#8220;But you know that he is after <i>something</i>.
There is a mystery about his actions&#8211;both here
at the house and up there in the rocks,&#8221; said
Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;ye-es.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been talking to father about it.
Father has seen him wandering about there so
much. His anxiety not to be seen has piqued
father&#8217;s curiosity, too. To tell the truth, that is
what has kept father so much interested in
getting specimens up yonder,&#8221; and the young man
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He tells me that he is sure there can be no
great mineral wealth on the farm; yet Spink has
found, or is trying to find, some deposit of value
here&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell him about the bottles, Lyd!&#8221; cried
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that may be nothing&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What bottles?&#8221; demanded Harris, quickly.
&#8220;Come on, girls, why not take me fully into your
confidence? I might be of some use, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they were nothing but bottles of water,&#8221;
objected Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bottles of water?&#8221; repeated the young
chemist, slowly. &#8220;Who had them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spink,&#8221; replied &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he doing with them?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>She told him how they had watched the professor
with his inexplicable water bottles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foolish; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&#8211;until we get the clue to it. Foolish
to us, but mighty important to Professor Spink.
Therefore we ought to look into it. Father
doesn&#8217;t know anything about this bottle business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s Sunday,&#8221; sighed &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t do anything about the mystery to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her sister was fully roused, and when Lyddy
determined on a thing, something usually came
of it.</p>

<p>After breakfast, and after she had seen Lucas
and his mother and Sairy drive past on their way
to chapel, she put on her sunbonnet and started
boldly for the neighboring farm, determined to
have an interview with Cyrus Pritchett.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SECRET REVEALED</span></h2>

<p>Lyddy did not have to go all the way to the
Pritchett farm to speak with its proprietor. The
farmer was wandering up Hillcrest way, looking
at the growing corn, and she met him at the corner
where the two farms came together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Pritchett,&#8221; she said, abruptly, &#8220;I want
to ask you a serious question.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in his surly way&#8211;from under
his heavy brows&#8211;and said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew Mr. Spink when you were both
boys; didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s look sharpened, but he only
nodded. Cyrus was very chary of words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Spink left Hillcrest this morning. Last
night my sister caught him in the east wing, trying
to break open grandfather&#8217;s desk with a burglar&#8217;s
jimmy. I am not at all sure that I shan&#8217;t have
him arrested, anyway,&#8221; said Lyddy, with rising
wrath, as she thought of the false professor&#8217;s
actions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha!&#8221; grunted Mr. Pritchett.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>&#8220;Now, sir, you know <i>why</i> Spink came to Hillcrest,
<i>why</i> he has been searching up there among
the rocks, and <i>why</i> he wanted to get at grandfather&#8217;s
papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; returned the farmer, flatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Spink were up at Hillcrest the first
night we girls slept there. And you frightened
my sister half to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man blinked at her, but never said a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were there with Spink the evening
Lucas took &#8217;Phemie and me down to the Temperance
Club&#8211;the first time,&#8221; said Lyddy, with
surety. &#8220;You slipped out of sight when we drove
into the yard. But it was you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was; eh?&#8221; growled Mr. Pritchett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. And I want to know what it means.
What is Spink&#8217;s intention? What does he want
up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell ye,&#8221; responded Pritchett.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you won&#8217;t tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I say what I mean,&#8221; growled Pritchett.
&#8220;Jud Spink never told me what he wanted. I
was up to the house with him&#8211;yep. I let him go
into the cellar that night you say your sister was
scart. But I didn&#8217;t leave him alone there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>why</i>?&#8221; gasped Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can easy tell you my side of it,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
farmer. &#8220;Jud and me was something like chums
when we was boys. When he come back here a
spell ago he heard I was storing something in the
cellar under the east wing of the house. He told
me he wanted to get into that cellar for something.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I met him up there that night. I opened
the cellar door and we went down. I kept a
lantern there. Then I found out he wanted to
go farther. There&#8217;s a hatch there in the floor of
the old doctor&#8217;s workshop&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A trap door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you let him up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naw, I didn&#8217;t. He wouldn&#8217;t tell me what
he wanted in the old doctor&#8217;s offices. I stayed
there a while with him&#8211;us argyfyin&#8217; all the time.
Then we come away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On Saturday night? I caught him trying to
break in at the cellar door. I warned him not
to try no more tricks, and I told him if he did
I&#8217;d make it public. We ain&#8217;t been right good
friends since,&#8221; declared Mr. Pritchett, chewing
reflectively on a stalk of grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s all about?&#8221;
demanded Lyddy, disappointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more&#8217;n you do,&#8221; declared Mr. Pritchett;
&#8220;or as much.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>&#8220;Oh, dear me!&#8221; cried Lyddy. &#8220;Then I&#8217;m
just where I was when I started!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanter watch Jud Spink,&#8221; grumbled Mr.
Pritchett, rising from the fence-rail on which he
had been squatting. &#8220;Does he want to buy the
farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;I guess not. He only made Aunt
Jane a small offer for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make a bigger,&#8221; said Pritchett, clamping
his jaws down tight on that word, and turned
on his heel.</p>

<p>She knew there was no use in trying to get more
out of him then. Cyrus Pritchett had &#8220;said his
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Lyddy got back to the house again she
found that Grandma Castle&#8217;s folks had come to
see her in their big automobile, and she and &#8217;Phemie
had to hustle about with Mother Harrison
to re-set the enlarged dining table and make other
extra preparations for the unexpected visitors.</p>

<p>So busy were they that the girls did not miss
Harris Colesworth and his father. They appeared
just before the late dinner, rather warm
and hungry-looking for the Sabbath, Harris bearing
something in his arms carefully wrapped about
in newspapers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what have you got?&#8221; &#8217;Phemie gasped,
having just a minute to speak to the young man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>&#8220;Samples of the water Spink has bottled up
there,&#8221; returned Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But we&#8217;ll find out. Father
has an idea, and if it&#8217;s <i>so</i>&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what?&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You just wait!&#8221; returned Harris, hurrying
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mean thing!&#8221; &#8217;Phemie called after him.
&#8220;You oughtn&#8217;t to have any dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was little chance for Harris to talk
with the girls that day. Before the dinner dishes
were cleared away, a thunder cloud suddenly
topped the ridge, and soon a furious shower fell,
with the thunder reverberating from hill to hill,
and the lightning flashing dazzlingly.</p>

<p>Behind this shower came a wind-storm that
threatened, for a couple of hours, to do much
damage. Everybody was kept indoors, and as
the night fell dark and threatening the Castles
had to be put up until morning.</p>

<p>The wind quieted down at last; so did the
nervous members of the party inside Hillcrest.
When Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie thought almost everybody
else was abed but themselves, and they were
about to lock up the house and retire, a candle
appeared in the long corridor, and behind the
candle was Harris Colesworth, fully dressed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>&#8220;Sunday is about over, girls,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
I can&#8217;t possibly sleep. I must do something.
Didn&#8217;t you tell me, Miss &#8217;Phemie, there were
retorts and test-tubes, and the like, in your grandfather&#8217;s
rooms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the east wing?&#8221; cried Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the back room was his laboratory. All
the things are there,&#8221; said the younger girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go in there, then,&#8221; said Harris,
eagerly. &#8220;I want to test these samples of water
father and I brought down from the rocks to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mercy me!&#8221; gasped &#8217;Phemie. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s gold&#8211;or silver&#8211;held in
solution in that water&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>Lyddy laughed. &#8220;How ridiculous!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not exactly ridiculous,&#8221; returned
Harris, shaking his head, and smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Harris Colesworth! who ever heard of
such a thing?&#8221; cried Lyddy. &#8220;I&#8217;m no chemist,
but I know <i>that</i> would be impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me have the key of the green
door?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie, who had continued to
carry it tied around her neck. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll go with
you and see you perform your nefarious rites, Mr.
Magician!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>Lyddy went for a lamp and brought it, lighted.
&#8220;A candle won&#8217;t do you much good in there,&#8221;
she said to Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Verily, it is so!&#8221; admitted the young man,
with an humble bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let me go first!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;You&#8217;d both be scared stiff by my friend, Mr.
Boneypart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your friend <i>who</i>?&#8221; cried Lyddy.</p>

<p>Harris began to laugh. &#8220;So you claim Napoleon
as your friend; do you, Miss &#8217;Phemie?
What do you suppose old Spink thinks about
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8217;Phemie giggled as she ran ahead with the young
man&#8217;s candle and closed the door of the skeleton
case in the inner office.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the simple tests I have to make,&#8221; said
Harris, as Lyddy&#8217;s lamp threw a mellow light into
the room, &#8220;I see no reason why those old tubes
won&#8217;t do. Yes! there&#8217;s about what I want on
that bench.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, oh! the dust!&#8221; sighed Lyddy, trying to
find a clean place on which to set the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandfather must have been something
of a chemist as well as a medical sharp,&#8221; observed
Harris, gazing about. &#8220;I&#8217;m curious to
look this place over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to ask Aunt Jane,&#8221; said Lyddy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
doubtfully. &#8220;We really haven&#8217;t any business in
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never told us we shouldn&#8217;t come,&#8221; &#8217;Phemie
returned, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you young ladies sit down and keep
still,&#8221; commanded Harris, authoritatively, removing
his coat and tying an apron around his
waist&#8211;the apron being produced from his own
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now if you had your straw cuffs you&#8217;d look
just as you used to&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the shop, eh?&#8221; finished Harris, when
Lyddy caught herself up quick in the middle of
this audible comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-es.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you <i>did</i> notice me a bit when you were
working around the little kitchen of that flat?&#8221;
chuckled the young man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; gasped Lyddy. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t very
well help remembering how you looked the night
of the fire when you came sliding across to our
window on that plank. <i>That</i> was so ridiculous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; responded Harris, calmly. &#8220;Now,
please be still, young ladies and&#8211;watch the professor!&#8221;</p>

<p>And for an hour the girls did actually manage
to keep as still as mice. Their friend certainly
was absorbed in the work before him. He tested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
one sample of water after another, and finally
went back and did the work all over upon one
particular bottle that he had brought down from
Spink&#8217;s hiding place among the rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I thought,&#8221; he declared, with a satisfied
smile. &#8220;And just as father suspected. Prepared
to be surprised&#8211;pleasantly. Your Aunt
Jane must be warned not to sell Hillcrest at <i>any</i>
price&#8211;just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why not?&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I believe there is a valuable mineral
spring on it. This is a sample of it here. Mineral
waters with such medicinal properties as this
contains can be put on the market at an enormous
profit for the owner of the spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go into the scientific jargon of it
now,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;But the spring is here&#8211;up
there among the rocks. Spink knows where it
is. That is his secret. <i>We</i> must learn where
the water flows from, and likewise, see to it that
your Aunt Jane makes no sale of the place until
the matter is well thrashed out and the value
of the water privilege discovered.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN AUTOMOBILE RACE</span></h2>

<p>Lyddy was to write to Aunt Jane the next day.
That was the decision when Harris started for
town after breakfast, too. No time was to be
lost in acquainting Aunt Jane with the fact that
the old doctor spoke truly when he had said that
&#8220;there were curative waters on Hillcrest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Dr. Polly Phelps&#8217;s day a mineral spring
would have been of small value compared to
what it would be worth now. Jud Spink, of
course, had known something about the old
doctor&#8217;s using in his practise the water from
somewhere among the rocks. On the lookout
for every chance to make money in
these days, the owner of &#8220;Stonehedge Bitters&#8221;
and &#8220;Diamond Grits&#8211;the Breakfast of the Million&#8221;
had determined to get hold of Hillcrest and
put the mineral water on the market&#8211;if so be
the spring was to be discovered.</p>

<p>Too penurious to take any risk, however, Spink
had wished to be sure that the mineral spring was
there, and of its value, before he risked his good
money in the purchase of the property.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>The question now was: Had he satisfied himself
as to these facts? Had he found the mineral
spring quite by chance, and was he not still in
doubt as to the wisdom of buying Hillcrest?</p>

<p>It would seem, by his trying to get at the old
doctor&#8217;s papers, that Spink wished to assure himself
further before he went ahead with his scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put a spoke in his wheel&#8211;that&#8217;s sure,&#8221;
said Harris, as he bade the two girls good-bye
that Monday morning, while Lucas and the restive
ponies waited for him.</p>

<p>In two hours he was back at the farmhouse.
The ponies stopped at the door all of a lather, and
both Harris and Lucas looked desperately excited.
Tom Castle, as well as the Bray girls, ran
out to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off!&#8221; shouted Lucas Pritchett. &#8220;He&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to beat ye to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you talking about, Lucas?&#8221; demanded
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does your aunt live, Miss Lyddy?&#8221;
asked the young chemist. &#8220;Not at Easthampton?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. At Hambleton. She is at home
now&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that Spink just bought a ticket for Hambleton,
and has taken the train for that particular
burg,&#8221; declared Harris, with emphasis. &#8220;If I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
only been sure of your Aunt Jane&#8217;s address I
would have gone with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think he&#8217;s gone to try to buy
the farm of her?&#8221; questioned Lyddy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I most certainly do. He couldn&#8217;t have made
connections easily had he started yesterday after
you drove him away from Hillcrest. But he&#8217;s
after the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;ll sell it! she&#8217;ll sell it!&#8221; wailed
&#8217;Phemie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; ventured Lyddy, but her lips
were white.</p>

<p>&#8220;He can get an option. That&#8217;s enough,&#8221;
urged Harris. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to head him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; cried the older girl, clasping her
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jumping horse chestnuts!&#8221; ejaculated Tom
Castle. &#8220;It&#8217;s a cinch! It&#8217;s easy. You can beat
that fellow to Hambleton by way of Adams&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no other train that connects at the
junction till afternoon,&#8221; objected Lucas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aw, poof!&#8221; exclaimed Tom. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we
got the old buzz-wagon right here? I&#8217;ll run and
see father. He&#8217;ll let me take it. We&#8217;ll go over
the hill and down to Adams, and take the east
road to Hambleton. Why, say! that Spink man
won&#8217;t beat us much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great scheme, Tommy!&#8221; shouted Harris
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
Colesworth &#8220;Go ahead. Tell your father
I can run the car, if you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>In twenty minutes the big car was rolled out
of the barn, and Mr. Castle came out to see the
quartette off,&#8211;the two girls in the tonneau and
Harris and Tom Castle on the front seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see that he doesn&#8217;t play hob with that
machine, Mr. Colesworth,&#8221; called Mr. Castle,
as they started. &#8220;It cost me seven thousand
dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s seven thousand dollars,&#8221; demanded
Master Tom, recklessly, &#8220;to putting the Indian
sign on that Professor Spink?&#8221;</p>

<p>They were not at all sure, however, that they
were going to be able to do this. Professor Spink
might easily beat them to Aunt Jane&#8217;s residence in
Hambleton.</p>

<p>But at the speed Tom took the descent of the
ridge on the other side, one might have thought
that the professor was due to board a flying
machine if he wished to travel faster. &#8217;Phemie
declared she lost her breath at the top of the hill
and that it didn&#8217;t overtake her again until they
stopped at the public garage in Adams to get a
supply of gasoline.</p>

<p>The boys behind the wind-break, and the girls
crouching in the tonneau, saw little of the landscape
through which the car rushed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>They rolled into Hambleton without mishap,
and before noon. A word from Lyddy put
Master Tom on the right track of Aunt Jane&#8217;s
house, for he had been in the town before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here quicker than we could have had
a telegram delivered,&#8221; declared Harris, as he
helped the girls out of the car. &#8220;I&#8217;m going in
with you, Miss Lyddy&#8211;if you don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course you shall come!&#8221; returned
Lyddy, really allowing her gratitude to &#8220;spill
over&#8221; for the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me&#8211;oh, my!&#8221; whispered &#8217;Phemie, walking
demurely behind them. &#8220;The end of the world
has now <i>came</i>. Lyd is showing that poor young
man some favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>But &#8217;Phemie, as well as the other two, grew
serious when the girl who opened the door told
them Mrs. Hammond had company in the parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two gentlemen, Miss&#8211;on business,&#8221; said the
maid.</p>

<p>Just then they heard Professor Spink&#8217;s booming
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh! he&#8217;s here ahead of us!&#8221; cried &#8217;Phemie,
and she flung open the door and ran into the
room.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HILLCREST COMPANY, LIMITED</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sign it!&#8221; shrieked &#8217;Phemie, seeing
Aunt Jane, her bonnet on as usual, with a pen
in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the good land&#8217;s sake, child! how you
scart me,&#8221; complained the old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sign anything, Aunt!&#8221; urged &#8217;Phemie.
&#8220;That man is trying to cheat you,&#8221; and she
pointed a scornful finger at Professor Spink.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, girl?&#8221; demanded the
other man present, who was sitting next to Mrs.
Hammond. He looked like what he was&#8211;a
shyster lawyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;This girl is crazy,&#8221; snarled Spink, glaring at
the party of young people.</p>

<p>&#8220;So are we all, then,&#8221; Harris Colesworth responded.
&#8220;I assure you, Mrs. Hammond, that
these men are trying to trick you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno you, young man; but I <i>do</i> know my
own mind. This man, Spink, has finally made
me a good offer for Hillcrest Farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you don&#8217;t sign that paper at once,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
ma&#8217;am,&#8221; suggested the lawyer, softly, &#8220;the deal
is off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; declared Spink, rising. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made my last offer&#8211;take it or leave it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do they offer you for the farm,
Mrs. Hammond&#8211;if that&#8217;s not a rude question?&#8221;
demanded Harris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never <i>you</i> mind!&#8221; blustered Spink.</p>

<p>But Aunt Jane stated the amount frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth more,&#8221; said Harris, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect it is; but it ain&#8217;t worth no more to
me,&#8221; replied the old lady, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll raise their offer a hundred dollars,&#8221; said
Harris, quickly. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Colesworth. My
father and I are well known here and in Easthampton.
We are amply able to pay you cash
for the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; observed Aunt Jane, with satisfaction,
while the girls stared at the young fellow
in wonder, &#8220;you are talking business. A hundred
dollars more is not to be sneezed at&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll raise the young man&#8217;s bid another
hundred, Mrs. Hammond,&#8221; interposed the lawyer,
eagerly. &#8220;But you must sign the agreement&#8213;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Raise you another hundred,&#8221; said Harris.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at his client for instructions.
Professor Spink&#8217;s face was of an apoplectic hue
and his eyes fairly snapped.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he shouted, pounding one fat fist
into his other hand. &#8220;I know this smooth
swindler. He did me once before just this way.
He sha&#8217;n&#8217;t do it now. He&#8217;s got some inside information
about that farm. It&#8217;s all off! I
wouldn&#8217;t buy the old place now at any price!&#8221;</p>

<p>He grabbed his hat and rushed for the door.
The little lawyer followed, seized his coattails,
and tried to drag him back; but Professor Spink
was the heavier, and he steamed out into the hall,
towing the lawyer, opened the door, and finally
dashed down the steps. He and his legal adviser
disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young man,&#8221; said Mrs. Hammond,
calmly, &#8220;I expect you know what you have done?
You&#8217;ve spoiled that sale for me; I may hold you
to your offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to, I shall not worry,&#8221; laughed
Harris, sitting down. &#8220;But let us tell you all
about it, Mrs. Hammond, and then I believe you
will think twice before you sell Hillcrest at <i>any</i>
price.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Right in that boarding-house parlor was laid
the foundation of the now very wealthy mineral
water concern known as &#8220;The Hillcrest Company,
Limited.&#8221; But, of course, it was months before
the concern was launched and the wonderfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span>
curative waters of Hillcrest Spring were put upon
the market.</p>

<p>For once the fact was established that the mineral
spring was there among the rocks at the back
of the farm, it was only a matter of searching
for it.</p>

<p>The spring was finally located in the very wildest
part of the farm&#8211;in a deep thicket, where the
cattle, or other animals, never went to drink. So
the spring was thickly overgrown.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by cracky! you can&#8217;t blame a cow for
not wanting to drink <i>that</i> stuff,&#8221; declared Lucas
Pritchett when he first tasted the water.</p>

<p>Medicinally, however, it was a valuable discovery.
Bottled and put on sale, it was soon
being recommended by men high in the medical
world.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old doctor knew a thing or two, even
if he <i>did</i> live back here on the lonesomest hill in
the State,&#8221; said Aunt Jane. &#8220;No! I won&#8217;t stay,
children. You&#8217;ve treated me fust-rate; but give
me the town. I want life. I don&#8217;t see how Mrs.
Castle can stand it. I&#8217;d vegetate here in a week
and take sech deep root that you couldn&#8217;t pull me
out with a stump-puller.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, I&#8217;m going to have money enough
now to live jest like I want to in town. And I&#8217;m
going to have one of these automobile cars&#8211;yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307'></a>307</span>
sir! I&#8217;ll begin to really and truly <i>live</i>, I will.
You jest watch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But in her joy of suddenly acquired wealth she
did not forget her nieces&#8211;the girls who had
really made her good fortune possible. Both
Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie owned stock in the mineral
water company; and then Aunt Jane assured them
that when she died they should own the farm
jointly. She had only sold the spring rights to
the company.</p>

<p>The rest of the corporation consisted of Harris
Colesworth and his father, Rufus Castle, his
mother, Grandma Castle, Lucas Pritchett and&#8211;last
but not least&#8211;Mother Harrison. The widow
had asked the privilege of investing in the stock of
the company the fifty dollars that Professor Spink
had paid her for her husband&#8217;s old desk.</p>

<p>And as that stock is becoming more and more
valuable as time goes on, it was not an unwise investment
on the widow&#8217;s part. As for Lucas, it
was by &#8217;Phemie&#8217;s advice that the young farmer
put <i>his</i> money into the stock of the mineral water
concern, instead of into a red-wheeled buggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a while, Lucas,&#8221; said &#8217;Phemie, &#8220;and
you&#8217;ll make money enough to own a motor car
instead of a buggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll take the first ride in it with me?&#8221;
demanded Lucas, shrewdly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308'></a>308</span>&#8220;Yes! I&#8217;ll verily risk my life in your buzz-wagon,&#8221;
laughed the girl. &#8220;But now! that&#8217;s a
long way ahead yet, Lucas.&#8221;</p>

<p>The summer had passed ere all these things
were done and said. Nor had the Bray girls lost
a single opportunity of making their original venture&#8211;that
of keeping boarders at Hillcrest&#8211;a
success.</p>

<p>Lyddy had bought her cooking stove, her chickens
had turned out a nice little flock for the next
year, the garden had done splendidly, and when
the corn was harvested the girls banked a hundred
dollars over and above the cost of raising the
crop.</p>

<p>Best of all, their father&#8217;s state of health had
so much improved, during these last few weeks,
that the girls could look forward with confidence
to his complete restoration, in time, to a really
robust condition.</p>

<p>Hillcrest had been his salvation. The sun and
air of the mountainside home had finally brought
him well on the road to recovery; and the joy his
two daughters felt because of this fact can scarcely
be expressed in words.</p>

<p>Grandma Castle and the Chadwicks wanted to
remain until New Year&#8217;s, so the girls got no real
vacation. Several automobile parties had now
found their way to the house on the hill, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span>
old-fashioned viands, the huge rooms, open fires,
and all the &#8220;queer&#8221; furniture induced them to
return from time to time.</p>

<p>So Lyddy and &#8217;Phemie decided to be prepared
for such parties, or for other people who wished
to board for a week or so at a time, all winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Bray had grown so much stronger by now
that sometimes he expressed his belief that he
ought to go back to the shop and earn money,
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till next season, Father,&#8221; Lydia urged
him, softly. &#8220;We can all pull together here, and
if we have only a measure of good fortune, we
shall be independent indeed by <i>next</i> fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prospect was surely bright&#8211;as bright as
that which lay before Lyddy and Harris Colesworth
one Indian summer day as they strolled
down the lane to the highroad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how Aunt Jane can find this place
lonely,&#8221; sighed Lyddy, leaning just a little on the
young man&#8217;s arm, but with her gaze sweeping
all the fair mountainside.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> couldn&#8217;t leave it, Lyddy?&#8221; he asked,
with sudden wistfulness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed! Not for long. No other place
would seem like <i>home</i> to me after our experience
here. It&#8217;s more like home than the house I was
born in at Easthampton.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310'></a>310</span>&#8220;You see, we have struggled, and worked, and
accomplished something here&#8211;&#8217;Phemie and I.
And Aunt Jane says it shall some day be ours&#8211;all
of Hillcrest. I love it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;I don&#8217;t blame you!&#8221; exclaimed Harris,
suddenly swinging about and seizing her hands.
&#8220;But, say, Lyddy! don&#8217;t be stingy about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stingy&#8211;about what?&#8221; she asked him, rather
frightened, but looking up into his sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be stingy with Hillcrest. If you are
determined to stay here&#8211;all your life long&#8211;you
know&#8213; Don&#8217;t you suppose you could find it
in your heart to let <i>me</i> come here and&#8211;and stay,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody heard Lyddy Bray make an audible
reply to this&#8211;not even the curious squirrel chattering
in the big beech over their heads. But
Harris seemed to see just the reply he craved in
the girl&#8217;s eyes, for he cried, suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>dear</i>, you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they walked on together, side by side,
over the carpet of flame-colored leaves.</p>
